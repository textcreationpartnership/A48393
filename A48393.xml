         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHEN any Gentleman or other Perſon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of a good Breed of Horſes or Mares, that may redound to his Pleaſure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, the chief thing is to Elect a Stallion and Mare, or Mares, in whom Nature has not been defective, but rather fitted and framed for Beauty, and promiſing ſervice of what kind ſoever, ſhall be premeditated or propoſed by the Maſter: And in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:110035:19"/>
               <p>Thoſe that have been Curious in theſe matters, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree, That the Mare for breed ought to be about four years old, altogether free from Diſeaſes and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, clear limbed and well proportioned, her Eyes lively and ſparkling, ſtanding ſomewhat out of her Head, her Ears ſtanding direct, her Buttocks broad and well fleſhed, with a large Womb, little Head, well-ſet Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and an Arched Neck; her Legs even, and her Neighing ſharp and clear, with fair Hoofs and large Ribs, one that is not uſed to trip, ſtumble, interfere, or given to any untowardly vice. And to anſwer her, The Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ought to have a little Head, inclining to leanneſs, a ſwelling Forehead, full Ears, with Eyes quick and ſtanding out, being ſomewhat ſpeckled with Blood, his Noſe crookt, or bending, his Noſtrils wide, and Neck arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, with a large throple and curling Mane, broad and well-ſet Shoulders, large Knee-joynts and lean Legs, a well-ſet Cheſt, broad Back, large Ribs, a gaunt Belly, Straits, Fillets and good Paſterns well knit and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned; of Colour bright Bay or Cole black, though in this caſe other Colours may prove good both as to the Mare and Stallion, as will appear when I come to deſcribe the Goodneſs by the Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A good choice thus made, it will be altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to feed your Stallion for a time in the Stable with heartning Provinder, as Splent-beans, Oats or ſod Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, to render him luſty and mettleſome; yet let him feed on good green Paſture, at leaſt a day before you ſuffer him to back your Mare, for fear that by reaſon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the Mare be notwithſtanding defective in concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to remedy that fault, occaſioned moſtly by two much Blood, take a pint of Blood from either ſide her Neck four or five days before your Horſe Covers her; and the day after bleeding, take a quart of warm Milk, half a pint of the Juyce of Mugwort, <hi>London</hi>-Treacle and ſweet Butter, of each two ounces: diſſolve them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and being well mixed, give them to her in a Drenching-horn luke-warm, and you will find the effects anſwer your expectation, eſpecially if twice or thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the ſucceeding mornings when ſhe is faſting. Now if ſhe has conceived well, her Belly within four or five days will appear gaunt, her Hair more bright and ſhining, her regard of Horſes or noiſes will be little, her Ears will flag, and ſhe will decreaſe in fleſh. Ways there are to oblige either Stallion or Mare, in caſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs, by rubbing a Spunge in the Mares Shape, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some are of opinion, that knitting the right Stone of the Horſe with a Liſt or ſilken Cord, will occaſion a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Colt, and the contrary a Male; but how often that has failed, there are few Horſe-keepers ignorant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to follow Experience, the beſt Miſtriſs, obſerve, that if you would be ſure of a Stone-Colt, to let your Mare be covered when <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer</hi> or <hi>Leo,</hi> are predominant, which are called Maſculine Signs, and as well rule Irrational as Rational Creatures; and if your deſires are contrary, then let <hi>Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius</hi> and <hi>Piſces</hi> be your Rule: For as Heat and Moiſture are the great diſtinguiſhers of the Sex, ſo the Signs influencing more or leſs, are not a little concerned as Second Cauſes, in the production of things participating of their temperature.</p>
               <p>For the ſpace of three weeks, or ſomewhat longer, after Covering, ſhe muſt or ought to be kept in a warm Houſe and Dieted, leaſt the Conception happen to be impaired before the Colt be well formed; and after that ſhe muſt not be hard rid nor laboured, neither come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Ground or Stable where unruly Cattel are, or where, by attempting to leap, ſhe may injure her ſelf, leaſt thereby her Maſters expectation be fruſtrated by Miſcarriage, or the Colt's being bruiſed and diſtorted in the Womb; obſerving the Ground ſhe runs in be dry, well ſheltered with ſpreading Trees, Barns, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets or Out-houſes, under or into which ſhe may retire at leaſure; nor will it be unneceſſary to have Racks with Provinder placed where ſhe may advantageouſly come at them.</p>
               <p>The time that a Mare goes with Fold, unleſs ſome miſchance happen, is, by the moſt curious Obſervers, a year and ten days, though ſome will have it twelve months within eleven days, and ſome a ſhorter time. This, I confeſs, as to a young Mare, in her firſt Teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, does often fall out; but upon the ſecond Foaling rarely or never: For if your Mare be Covered about the middle of <hi>December,</hi> which is the beſt time that ſhe may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110035:20"/>have the advantage of the Summer to run in, and the following Spring to bring up her Colt; ſhe will be ſure to Foal about the latter end of <hi>December</hi> in the following year, as has been frequently obſerved. When the time of her Foaling is at hand, let thoſe whoſe charge it is be aſſiſting to her in caſe of emergency, ſhe being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a warm Houſe without any Halter or other cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome thing about her whereby ſhe may be hindred or cauſed to ſlip or ſtumble, being eaſed in her lying down with clean Litter, or layed to receive the Colt, if ſhe caſt it ſtanding, as often it happeneth; and when ſhe has dryed the Colt with licking, let the Milk be drawn from her Teats before he be ſuffered to ſuck her, to prevent it's clotting in the Udder; and if ſhe be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Milk, to prevent dryneſs and encreaſe it, give her warm Maſhes, with ſome Powder of Brimſtone and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein Scabeous or Vervine have been boiled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing her Dugs with the Decoction of Lavender and Spike; and ſo a Month or two after you may work or ride her gently: But beware if ſhe return hot, let her cool before the Colt take the Teat, leaſt the humours being too much ſtirred, the heat of the Milk being too greedily taken, ſurfeit him. And thus a good Mare will bring forth able Colts till ten years, and a Stallion get them till twelve; but thoſe that on either part happen beyond, will prove weaklings, and not worth the rearing. And thus much for procuring a Colt; which if carefully reared, will unqueſtionably make a good Horſe or Mare. Wherefore to leave nothing of that kind in the dark, I ſhall proceed to direct in the following Chapter what is neceſſary to be done till the time of Backing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from thence onward to the reſt, more materially to be known by the Reader.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Though what has been ſaid be exactly obſerved and performed, yet a Colt, after it is brought forth, may be ſpoiled by neglect, or for want of Management in his tender Age; which is the next thing requiſite to be taken notice of, that proceeding gradually in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the ſeveral Stations of ſo accurate a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I may be eaſily traced in my Method, and thereby the better and more exactly underſtood, plainneſs and brevity being the marks at which I aim; and yet that in ſo accompliſhing my deſign, nothing may be wanting that may conduce to the advantage of any.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing neceſſary to know, whether a Colt will make a Horſe, and when arrived to Maturity, is the Obſervation of his Linaments; the meaſures in that kind to be taken thus: <hi>Viz.</hi> Obſerve whether the Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones be ſtrait and even, of a convenient thickneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a durable or firm proportion, that thereby his tallneſs and ability may be perſpicuous or apparent; for in conſideration of the proportion between the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and the Knee you may expect a duplicity, or as much more in the hight, when at full growth: Obſerve likewiſe that his Joynts be large, and that he be full boned, his Head ſmall, lean, and his Ears of a moderate ſize, ſtanding upright; and that when he ſtands in due proportion, or at eaſe, his hinder Legs ſtand rather back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than crimpling forward; or even which denotes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110035:21"/>ſpeed: Then conſider by his frisking or playing up and down, his ſhaking his Ears or Tail, ſtaring in your Face, or the like, his mettleſomeneſs, and conſequently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his other properties, as far as his tender age will give an inſight; for in this Creature, as in all others of what kind ſoever, there remains no certainty without induſtry as to the reducing them to the Service of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: And to prevent his pining when weaned, let him by all means be out of the hearing of his Dam; and that he may the better brook her abſence, make a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beſt Butter you can get, and Ruburb, Rue or Savine, and give him nouriſhing diet; as Maſhes, Splent-beans, boiled Oats and hot Bran, with ſomewhat that is green and juycey for the ſpace of three Months after: Nor indeed ought he to be uſed to hard Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der altogether till three years after his weaning, leaſt thereby he be induced to neglect his feeding, and ſo by pining hinder his growth and activity.</p>
               <p>If it be a Stone-Colt, ſeparate him from that of the other Kind at the expiration of a year, leaſt he ſpoil himſelf in attempting what he is not capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the better to prevent the endangering of either, is to put them into different Paſture, well fenced, to prevent leaping, and ſecured by Quick-ſets, Trees, Barns or other Out-houſes from heat and cold.</p>
               <p>If you deſign to make Geldings of your Stone-Colts, the proper time to Cut or Delapidate them is, when they are between nine and twelve Days old, if the Sign of Life, which may be gathered from the Courſe of the Moon in her Wain, being either in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Virgo,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Spring or Fall, which are accounted the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſeaſons, though by thoſe that well underſtand this affair it may be done at any time, the Weather being dry, and not too hot or cold. And what now remains as to the bringing a Colt to perfection, is the Art of the Breeder, which may be, as the Vulgar term has it, the principal Verb; for if he neglect his charge, all that has been mentioned may prove ineffectual. Which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110035:22"/>Breeder I alſo term the Manager; for it is not enough to feed a Horſe well, that thereby he may be able limb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and high-mettled, but to bring him up to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Exerciſe, that may fit him for any imployment. And ſeeing many are ignorant in this affair, it will be highly neceſſary to give Directions after the beſt and moſt approved Manner and Method: which take from Experience, the beſt of Maſters, as followeth.</p>

               <p>VVHen your Colt comes to be of the Age of five years, which is a good time to oblige him to endure Backing, or the like, having before made your ſelf familiar with him, by ſtroaking, feeding and ſhaking the Bridle at his head, laying your hand on his back, ſmacking the Whip or cheriping, with ſuch other ſigns as are commonly uſed to create a ſufferance; lay your Saddle, not being over weighty, on his Back, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, as you obſerve his patience, either to increaſe the weight by a greater Saddle, or by placing on the leſſer ſomewhat that is ponderous, ſtroaking and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him the mean while that he may not be intent on what you are doing; and when you have brought him to a moderate ſufferance, Girt the Saddle with ſoft Girts, and that by degrees, looſening them as you find occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by his winching or untowardneſs, or ſtraitning them according to his patience or ſufferance: And ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110035:22"/>in caſe of your Bridle, which ought to be the ſecond thing applicable in reducing a Colt or young Horſe to obedience and obſervance of what tends to his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; but if you perceive a Colt, before he arrive at any convenient Maturity, to be over-mettleſome, it will be prudent to make him familiar, though at a year old, yet not to preſs his Back with weights for fear of ſwaying it; and ſo by a timely taming him, render the Men of other Nations miſtaken, who account the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, Turkey, Barbary, Pelopoeneſian, Flanders, Frieſland, Holiand</hi> and <hi>Artois</hi> Horſes and Mares the beſt: And the Reaſon they give is, that they may be made gentle at any Age; which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom they term of a ſtubborn nature, cannot be brought to: And indeed the taking them up too ſoon, without due Management, is the occaſion of ſtunting, and other-ways ſpoiling, of many a brave Colt or Horſe.</p>
               <p>If you find your Endeavour, in the manner aforeſaid, fail you in bringing a young Horſe or Mare to your bent; then conſider Loanlineſs may be the occaſion, or fear more than obſtinacy: To remedy which, oblige him or her to accompany thoſe that are Tame, and of a gentle nature already reduced to, what you deſign them, or at leaſt flexible on that occaſion; and by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerving, you handle them, a mildaeſs will be created, and a familiarity will increaſe to a deſire of the like; nor will moderate Rubbing and Picking the Feet be the leaſt means to introduce what elſe you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Some indeed, and thoſe the moſt curious in this affair, will not attempt to Back a Horſe which they intend for Travel or Racing, till the ſixth year: But, in my opinion, they loſe a years ſervice thereby to no manner of purpoſe; for the difference as to the one and the other in this kind, is inconſiderable, unleſs in caſe of extraordinary labour; for conſequently the longer the Horſe remains in good feeding undiſturbed, the ſtronger he grows in Joynt or Member, though leſs in ſwiftneſs.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:110035:23"/>
               <p>And ſeeing I have thus far proceeded, it will not be amiſs to give the Breeder an inſight into what more materially relates to his Duty and Office as to Diet and Dreſſing; in order to which he may apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the following Chapter.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110035:23"/>provoke him thereto by letting him ſcent Horſe-dung, muſty Hay, caſt Straw, or entring into Stubble or Brakes; and ſo in a gentle motion return him to your Stable, which ought rather to be Paved than Planked, to prevent dampneſs and unwholſome ſcents ariſing from the Urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Stagnates between the creviſes or chinks of the Plank, be they layed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo cloſe; of which I ſhall ſay more when I come to give Directions for a convenient Stable, fitting for choice Horſes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SEeing Racing is highly in eſteem, and a good Horſe of that kind much coveted by the Gentry of all Nations, I ſhall in this Chapter give an inſight into that affair: And firſt in chuſing a Horſe for Running; Conſider he be well managed, tractable, and no ways skittiſh, familiar with his Keeper or Maſter, and free in eating what is given him; lively and ſprightfull in his looks and action: Let him be one of an indifferent large reach, well ſet in the ſhoulders, and fairly hipped, gaunt and ſmooth backed, his legs and thighs ſtanding in due proportion, his head ſmall and lean, with faſt or firm cheek-bones, a ſharp, or Hawks Noſe, wide No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and wide Throple, and not exceeding twelve years old, nor under ſix being of a good breed: Nor is this all, for the main point of bringing him into a condition to Run ſucceſsfully is yet behind, which conſiſts in Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting, Dreſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carefully Ordering, before he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch a buſineſs: And in that caſe, if you would have him anſwer your expectation, obſerve theſe Rules, which are by the great Searchers into theſe Myſteries held to be the beſt and moſt exact that ever were.</p>
               <p>Reſolving to Run, and having matched your Horſe, the firſt thing you ought to do is, to have a regard to the ſtate and condition wherein he is, as to what relates to his Body in caſe of health, ſickneſs, or any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110035:24"/>or diſadvantage, and eſpecially to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: As whether he be newly taken from Graſs or Soil, and by that means his Body rendred foul and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy, over-burthened and incumbred with unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fatneſs or crudy humours; or, on the contrary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by bad uſage he is become poor and feeble, or that ſome hidden infirmity occaſion leanneſs or a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away: And, laſtly, whether he be in good liking or ſtate for your purpoſe, by having been moderately exerciſed and carefully regarded.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations weighed, if you find your Horſe in the firſt Eſtate, let him not be matched, if it will any way ſtand with your conveniency under ſix Weeks, or at leaſt not in leſs than a Month, that ſo he may be prepared by regular Diet and Applications for what he is to undertake.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Eſtate, unleſs your Horſe be neglected, ſix Weeks or a Month may ſuffice, for that his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe may be ſuted to his Feeding, and in that caſe no time loſt, if he that looks after him be carefull and induſtrious.</p>
               <p>As for the laſt Eſtate, it being a Medium between what has been mentioned, a Month with care is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time to bring him to perfection, though many allow ſix Weeks; but that is, as he is more or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to fatneſs or groſs humours, contracted in rank Paſture, or by cating foul Provinder. Now if it ſo happen, that any of theſe kinds be of a free and firey nature, apt to exceſs in Exerciſe, thereby to ſpend the fleſh he has got in Dieting; he that has the charge, muſt, as he ſees convenient, reſtrain him with a hard hand; and if he be defective in feeding, let him uſe what devices he can to prompt him to it, as by whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſinging, ſtroaking, clapping, rubbing, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſing his Provinder, and the like; though in the fat Horſe this ought chiefly to be obſerved; for the lean one, and that in good caſe, if not indiſpoſed by any diſtemper or grievance, will eat freely, and may be better exerciſed,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110035:25"/>not needing any reſtriction, unleſs upon extraordinary occaſions, though a tender regard muſt be had to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>THE Horſe you choſe, though naturally a good one, having contracted fatneſs or foulneſs by the means of too rank a Paſture or bad feeding; having put him into a dry and warm Stable, though ſomewhat darkiſh, to render him the better feeder, lead him out by the riſing of the Sun, ſuffering your Boy or Servant to give him a Turn or two till you have cleanſed the Stable of what is offenſive; then return him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your Bridle dipped in Beer, put it on, and tye him up to the Rack; at what time Curry him in every part, beginning with his Head, and ending with his Paſterns; then with a Horſe-tail, or clean Duſting-cloth, duſt him over: That done, take your French-Bruſh and rub him decently over in all parts by ſuch degrees as he may be ſenſible of your kind uſage: As, firſt the Forehead, then the Cheek, ſo down the Neck on either ſide, after that the Shoulders, Fore-legs, Back, Sides, Belly, Buttock, Rump, Thighs, Cambrils, and the very Fetlocks, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110035:25"/>and ſounding the Hoof to make it ſit the firmer: This done, paſs over him again with your wet hand to ſettle the Hair, and render him ſleek and ſhining; the wet being dried by a repetition, cleanſe his Sheath, Cods and Tuel, his Ears, Eyes and Noſtrils, his Mane, Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top and Tail, and rub the moiſture, if any remain, from between his hinder Thighs, picking his Hoofs, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over his Legs with dry Wiſps, or a clean Woollen-cloth, which, if you ſee convenient, paſs over his Body, combing his Mane, Tail and Foretop. Having thus far proceeded, take a large Body-cloth of Kerſey, or the like thick Woollen, and ſpread over him, if it happen in the Winter; but if in the Summer, that of a lighter Make will ſuffice; on that lay a light Saddle, girting it pretty ſtrait, yet let a wiſp or two ſtick on each ſide to give him the better breathing room, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Cloth likewiſe about his Breaſt and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Thus having dreſſed and attired your Horſe, ſpurt a little warm Beer into his Mouth, and lead him forth, and mount him, leaving one to order the Stable and provide good Litter againſt your return. Wheat-ſtraw being the beſt of that with which your Stable muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſufficiently provided for; other Straw is not only unſeemly, but unwholſome; the Oat-ſtraw breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſlike, and the Barley-ſtraw, if your Horſe be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to eat it, a ſcowring.</p>
               <p>Being abroad, ride your Horſe for ſome time a foot-pace, which, by the curious, is termed Racking; and after you have ſo managed him for the ſpace of a Mile or more upon firm ground, advance to a Hill that gently riſes, if the ſcituation of the place afford it; and mending by degrees his pace, bring him to Gallop up; the which when he has performed, lead him, or Rack him down to the beſt advantage, ſuffering him to cool and contract an equal temperature of body. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done, as you ſee your Horſe without over-ſtraining will conveniently bear it, lead him a Mile or thereabout
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110035:26"/>to ſome pleaſant River or Spring, and ſuffer him to drink moderately, and then Exerciſe him as before: Which done, give him a ſecond Watering; and after that another Exerciſe, ever obſerving to Exerciſe him before and after watering; which done, ride him eaſily home; and coming to the Stable-door, alight, ſuffering your Horſe to ſtale or dung in the foul litter; the which if he refuſe freely to do, provoke him to it by whiſtling, clapping or waving your Switch, raiſing the Straw under him, and reaching him upon it; which will often, if not always, oblige him to it, Cuſtome giving him an inſight into what you would have him to do. This done, lead him in, and fix him upon the clean Litter, take off the Saddle and Body-cloth, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him down, and cleanſing him as before; after which put on the Cloths, girt them gently with Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingles; and for the eaſement of his lying down, put wiſps between of looſe and ſoft Hay or Straw: Being thus cloathed, pick his Feet, and ſtop them with Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, caſting into the Rack a ſmall bottle of Hay well tyed up, it being well duſt, and let him tear it out at leaſure, whilſt he ſtands on his Bridle.</p>
               <p>Your Horſe having ſtood for the ſpace of an hour, rub his head well with a Hempen-cloth; and having cleanſed the Manger, draw his Bridle, and take about three pints of large white Oats well dreſſed, ſweet and dry, free from light Oats, or ſuch as are defective; for the preparing of which, you ought to have a ſmall Wire Sieve. Theſe being given to your Horſe and if with a good ſtomach he eat them, you may give him a quart more, and ſuffer him to reſt till towards noon; at what time run over thoſe parts the Cloth covers not, with a Rubber; and having cheriſhed him with your hand and voice, give him a quart of Oats more, doing the like at one and three of the Clock in the Afternoon; or if it be in the Summer-time, you may ſtay till four; and when it is near Sun-ſet, having rubbed and clad him at all points; as in the Morning lead him forth and Air

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110035:27"/>to do; and on ſuch emergent occaſions you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your Horſe a linnen Hood made of thick Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs, with a Bearing on the Nape of the Neck, and covering over the Ears, ſo that none but the Eyes and Noſe appear. The Heats you give, in caſe of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome weather, being to be given an hour before it is dark, and as ſoon as day ſprings, but not in the dark; for two Cauſes: As firſt to prevent unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Airs; and, laſtly, ſtumbling, tripping, ſlipping or falling.</p>
               <p>The manner of Heating thus obſerved, the next thing to be conſidered is the manner of Uſage and Diet for the ſecond Fortnight. Touching the firſt of theſe, there needs no great diſtinction between it; and what has been premiſed only before his Bridle be put on in the Morning, you muſt give him about three pints of the beſt Oats well ſifted; after the eating of which, dreſs him up and Bridle him, Cloath, Saddle, Air, Water, and return him in like manner; only what Hay you give, ſuffer him to take it out of your hand, and let him eat a pretty quantity if he deſire it; and while he does ſo, let him ſtand upon his Bridle; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, draw not the Bitt till an hour after; then having rubbed him all over, give him a quart more of well-ſifted Oats; and from this time forward make a Diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread to give him with his Oats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

But if the next day you intend to give him a Heat, then give him only a quart of the beſt Oats; and when he has eaten them, put on his Bridle and tye him up, not forgetting to rub him, and do what elſe is convenient; as Dreſſing, Airing, Watering, bringing him home and putting him into the Stable; where having let him

               <p>The beſt Muzzle for Summer is that which is made of ſmooth large Pack-thread or Whip-cord, well knit, yet ſo that the Horſe may freely breathe through the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: And the Winter-Muzzle, the beſt is of Canvas, with a ſquare Lattice of Tape at the bottom, both of them having convenient Loops and Strings to faſten them about the Napes of the Horſe's Neck.

               <p>Your Horſe having ſtood the ſpace of two hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> give him ſome Ears of Wheat to chew upon, and ſo by the extraordinary beating and motion of his Body, the ſhortneſs of his Breath, and dulneſs of his Eyes, you may perceive that the potion has met with abundance of bad Humours and groſs Crudities, with which it ſtrugles; and if ſo, you muſt forbear till the Sickneſs it will occaſion be over; at what time take off his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, turn up his Litter, and ſuffer him to lye down and eaſe himſelf for the ſpace of an hour; then rouſe him, and let him tear a ſmall bundle of Hay out of the Rack; in the mean while dreſs him a quart of Oats, and a pint of Splent-beans: mix them together, crumbling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them a ſlice or two of the before-named Bread, and then ſuffer him to reſt for the ſpace of three hours; and in the Evening, before you dreſs him, give him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the like quantity of Beans and Oats, cloathing him

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:110035:30"/>
               <p>The thing to be next obſerved, is to omit the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scowring, after you have given him other Heats; and in lieu thereof, give him a Ball made after the following manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Take Fenegreek and Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum-ſeeds, Anniſeeds and thoſe of Cummin, Colts-foot and Elecampane-Root, of each two ounces: and having bruiſed them, and ſifted off the Husks and groſſer part, add two ounces of the Flower of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and one of Licoriſh Powder: moiſten them with White-wine, and add more an ounce of the Chymical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oyl of Anniſeeds, Moloſſus and Olive-oyl, of each half a pint, and incorporate them with as much Flower as will make them up into balls as big as Pullets Eggs, and keep them in a thick Glaſs or well-glazed Pot for your uſe, they being good for a Horſe on ſundry other occaſions; as for Colds, Coughs, Glanders, Stoppage of the Stomach or ſhortneſs of Breath, in caſe of mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Greaſe or crudy Humours. And thus you may paſs him over the third Fortnight with good looking to, and a due obſervance of Heats, Airs and Diet; From which I proceed to the fourth and laſt Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, for ſo much time is ſufficient to bring any Horſe to perfection.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Fortnight obſerve to let his Bread be yet finer, as allowing three pecks of Wheat to one of Beans, reducing it to the moſt imaginable fineneſs by bolting and other ways dreſſing, lightning it up with a ſufficient quantity of new Ale Yeſt, Whites of Eggs and new Milk: working them to the beſt advantage, and baking them as the former, and give it him crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled amongſt the beſt Oats well ſifted, and well rubbed between your hands; as alſo Splent-beans freed from the Husks: Nor muſt you give him any Scowring, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther augment the potion of his Meat.

And this is often occaſioned in a young Horſe by the too much rigor of the Rider or Breaker, by which the Horſe is ſo confounded and over-feared, that he is not capable of underſtanding; or elſe Breaking through that fear, grows reſtiff and ſullen; when, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſweet words and mild behaviour wins ſo far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a good-natur'd Horſe, that in a ſhort time he will take pleaſure and pride in performing the Will of his Maſter; and when he readily does ſo, or at leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as far as his underſtanding will reach, he ought to be cheriſhed and encouraged, not only with words, but with ſome pleaſant and heartning morſel, which the Rider ought for that purpoſe to carry about him; at leaſt let him ſpurt ſome Wine, or other comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liquor, into his Mouth; and never correct him but when he is in a fault; always conſidering to ſtrike him in a convenient place, but not about the Head, leaſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110035:32"/>he dull him, or give him opportunity to be hardned in the Vice of going backward; nor with your Legs and Thighs preſs his Ribs too hard, leaſt his burthen become uneaſie and unpleaſant, ever conſidering in a ſtrait Courſe to keep a ſteady and even Rein, not inclining to the right nor to the left; and alſo an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Body, unleſs in a full Courſe; at what time a little ſtooping forward, but not ſo as to preſs your weight on the Horſes ſhoulders, will not be amiſs, for that will prevent gathering the Wind; the which, though it be unperceived by many, is a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the ſpeed of the Horſe. As for your Switch in ſuch caſes, it muſt be carried upright, or over the Horſe's head, that he may not ſee it, to affray him; nor decline your Body from the one ſide to the other to over-ſway him, but in all things obſerve a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and meen, being ever ſure to have your ground in your eye, and thereon manage your Horſe to the beſt advantage; as alſo which Ground he delights to tread, which in a Race may profit much; for it has been ſeen that many a good Horſe has been baulked by not being managed in ſuch Ground as they naturally affect.</p>
               <p>As for the Office of a good Groom, it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in keeping his Stable ſweet, clean and warm ſtored, with freſh Litter, by frequently renewing the old, having your Horſes Cloaths, Furniture and Materials ever in a readineſs; in being expert in the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times and manner of Airing and Feeding; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110035:32"/>as has skill in Horſes, and can diſcern the Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or the Symptoms of Diſeaſes, always having In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments ready to ſearch the Horſes feet, or Blood him upon neceſſary or emergent occaſions; and in caſe he ſee any imminent danger, he muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay giving notice thereof to his Maſter or the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, leaſt by neglect the Horſe may grow paſt cure; nor when a Horſe is returned from a Journey heated, or the like, muſt not neglect him, but ever be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Rub him well down; give him good Litter, Cloath him well, and let his Provender be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and ſeaſonable: For if a Horſe be newly taken up from Graſs or Soil, an exceſs of dry Meat will prove injurious by ſubjecting him to Lasks, ſhortneſs of Breath, Coſtiveneſs and Pains in the Stomach, as his ſuddainly being turned from hard Meat into rank Paſture will cauſe Laxativeneſs, Scowrings, Pains in the Belly, Rawneſs of Stomach and offenſive Rheums. And thus much may ſuffice for the Office of the Groom, who, as to the feeding of a Horſe, may take further Directions from what has been ſpoken of the Dieting the Race-Horſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Infallible Rules for Buying a good Horſe; and how ſo well by ſundry marks and tokens to diſtinguiſh good from bad, as well in caſe of ſoundneſs as diſeaſes, as thereby to prevent being impoſed on or cheated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>In the Election of a good Horſe many things are to be obſerved, and eſpecially to what end you deſign him when purchaſed; for certain it is, that no one Horſe, how perfect ſoever, can ſerve to all ends and purpoſes. Then for the goodneſs of his breed, it is very difficult to be known but by ſpeculation, unleſs you will take it upon the credit of thoſe that had the breeding of him, in which you run a hazard, for few Sellers will diſparage their own: However, this you may obſerve, that according to the Country this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhment is infallible: If he be of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> breed, then is he ſmall and neat limb'd; if <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> hook-noſed, if <hi>Dutch,</hi> rough-leged; if <hi>Barbary,</hi> neat bodied and headed; if <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> full and ſmooth buttocked; if <hi>Engliſh,</hi> well-ſet and ſtrongly joynted; and ſo for others. Now the Colours are various, according to the conſtitution of the Horſes Body, and by thoſe elected according as it likes the fancy of the Buyer, though there is difference in Goodneſs, to be known by the Colours, as the Horſe participates more or leſs of the ſeveral Elementary humours: And thus they are held.</p>
               <p>The Cole-black, without any mixture of other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Hairs, is ſubject to Choler, and the heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by occaſioned, inclines him to <hi>Peſtilence, Feavours, Inflamation</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> and other hot Diſeaſes:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110035:33"/>To prevent which, Purges that correct the Cholerick humours are very convenient; and Horſes of this complection are of a fierce and firey nature, good for War and Travel; but by reaſon of the heat, which conſumes the moiſture that ſhould ſupport them, they live not, or at leaſt laſt not long.</p>
               <p>A Horſe of a bright Bay or dark Bay, with a clear and cheerfull countenance, and a well-proportioned Mouth, is counted a laſting one, and fit for Racing, Hunting or Travel, and is of a ſanguine conſtitution; as alſo are the white-flanked or flea-bitten, white Loyard, with hairs like Silver, or black, with a white Star, white Foot, or white Raſh; and the Diſeaſes theſe are moſt ſubject to, are Conſumption of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Glaunders, Leproſie, and ſuch like diſorders as are taken by Infection or Contagion; wet and foul feeding in damp weather, and the like; and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſtronger Medicines than the former, without any danger, if they be not compounded of ſuch Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents as will over-heat the blood.</p>
               <p>A Horſe that is very white, py-bald, yellow, dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kile-glew'd, and the like, are Flegmatick, and fitteſt for Cart and Plow, or to labour in Mills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not being capable of ſpeed, or at leaſt not forced to hold it long; and are ſubject not only to looſe their fleſh, but to Staggars, Coughs, Catarrhs, cold Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Rheumatiſms, and the like diſorders proceeding from watery humours; and therefore in caſe of ſuch diſorders, hot Medicines are accounted the beſt and moſt ſucceſsfull.</p>
               <p>The Dark Bay, with long white hairs, Ruſſet, Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, Cheſnut, Grey or Mouſe-Dun, are accounted Melancholicks, and are ſubject to Inflamations of the Spleen, Dropſies, Frenſies, Oppreſſion of the Heart, and Pains in the Stomach. Wherefore being of a dry conſtitution, cold moiſt Medicines are requiſite to be Adminiſtred, and are generally heavy and lumpiſh; but if it happen you find a Horſe with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:110035:34"/>ſome or all of the Colours, the latter being very rare; then conclude, that the four Humours predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate by turns. And though theſe Obſervations are made for diſtinction ſake, yet it is found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which is the beſt Maſter, there are good Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or at leaſt tollerably good of all theſe kinds: Therefore not any ways to diſcourage the Buyer, or prejudice the Seller, that which follows ought duly to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>If you purchaſe a Horſe for eaſe and gentleneſs, though to Travel conſiderably, then the moſt fitting is an Ambler; then obſerve in the moving of his Legs, that he performs it equally, ſmooth, large, juſt and nimble; for if he tread falſe, he will prove uneaſie; Treading ſhort rids little ground; if he tread rough or uneven, he ſeems to rowl or tumble along.</p>
               <p>If Hunting be your aim, eſpecially that of the Buck, or for the riding Poſt, or the like, wherein a large Pace is required; the running or ſwift Amble, as ſome call it, is very neceſſary and expedient, differing from the other Amble only in the ſwiftneſs, and is altogether eaſie and delightfull.</p>
               <p>As for the Trot, or as ſome call it, the Lofty pace, it moſt properly belongs to War-Horſes, though indeed it may indifferently ſerve to any other end; and thoſe that Trot well, ſeldom fail to Gallop: In which caſe, obſerve that the Horſe take up his Legs nimbly from the ground, yet not raiſing them over high, nor rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Body from ſide to ſide, that he beat not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he forcibly laboured, or do it in pain, but that ſtretching out his fore-leg, he nimbly follow with the hinder; nor by any means Cut under the Knee, which is called the Swift-cut: Further obſerving, that he neither croſſeth one foot over or upon another, but with his far fore-foot ever leadeth, and not with the other. If theſe qualities are found, then is the Horſe good for ſpeed; but if he Gallop roundly, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtrongly his fore-feet, he is fitteſt for a Charging-Horſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110035:34"/>or one to be truſted in carrying his Maſter through a dangerous Attack. If his Gallop be ſlow, ſo it prove ſure, he may make a good Traveller; but if he handle his Legs confuſedly or ſhufflingly, then beware of ſome defect, eſpecially if he Gallop painfully.</p>
               <p>As for the Stature, that I leave to every Man's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as his occaſion ſutes or requires; the largeſt being for ſtrong and ſolid labour; the middle-ſize for ſwiftneſs and long Journeys, if not over-burthened; and the leſſer ſize for eaſe and moderate Recreation. And what more remains materially to be known of this kind, is the deformities and imperfections; That is, how to diſcover them; and theſe are contained in natural and accidental deformities, inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; many of them hidden, and ſo ſecretly couched, inſomuch that they may well deceive the skilfull: And of theſe, eſpecially of ſuch as are moſt dangerous or material to be known, I ſhall acquaint you.</p>
               <p>Firſt obſerve and inform your ſelf what you can as to the Breed and Paces of the Horſe; when having taken off the Saddle and Bridle, leaving a Halter only upon his head, cauſe him to be rubbed down well, and ſtand juſt before him, earneſtly beholding his countenance, whether it be cheerfull and ſprightly, free from cloudineſs or ſcowling; That his Ears be ſmall, ſharp, thin and plyable; and though they be inclining to longneſs, yet if they be well proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and well ſet on, it is not much amiſs, for his freeneſs, beauty and goodneſs of meettle are thereby declared; when, on the contrary, if they be loleing, thick, heavy, dull and clouterly, weakly ſet on, and ſeldom moving, dullneſs and a heavy diſpoſition are denoted. If the Forehead of the Horſe ſwell, and the feather or mark ſtand high above his Eyes, or on the top of his Eyes; if it happen he have a white Star, or white Blaze, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed, of an indifferent ſize; or if it be a ſnip on his Noſe, it is a mark of Beauty; but if his Face and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110035:35"/>Forehead be flat and cloudy, they are tokens of dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and defect; if the Star or Ranch be awry, or low, it is unſeemly; or the Noſe, inſtead of a ſnip, be bald, it ſignifies badneſs, and a Horſe not fit for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſervice; if the Eyes be brown, black, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſtaring or ſtanding out, and move with an equal motion, the black of the Eye filling the fleſhy Orb, ſo that little or nothing of the white appear, then is it a ſign of goodneſs, and a well-mettled Horſe; but, on the contrary, if the Eyes move flow and uneven, and the white greatly appear; if they ſeem cloudy or dull, then is it a ſign of badneſs, and the like, if they ſeem wrinkled, or are very ſmall; if they be of a firey red, they incline to Moon-blind or Moon-eyes, which are but a remove from blindneſs; if the Eyes be white and walled, it denotes a weak ſight; if very bloody, inclining to blackneſs, bruiſes are thereby ſignified; Red, dull Eyes, and a hollowneſs, fore-run blindneſs; if the Eyes Matter, and much Rheum flow from thence, then the Horſe has been extremely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by over-riding, or elſe is very old; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>When you come to handle the Horſe's Cheek or Chaps, if there you find the Bone thin and lean, the Wind-pipe or Throple full and large, even, and free from Knobs or Keruels, and the Jaws ſtanding even, ſo that the Teeth ſhut like a Box; and above ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the Neck may ſeem to ſhut or ſink into them, it is a ſign of a free Horſe, and one of great Wind and Courage; but, on the contrary, if his Chaps and Cheeks be thick, fat, and ſullenly inclined, the Throple ſmall, and muffled up with a thick groſs ſubſtance of fat, then (eſpecially if it appear much kernelly) it not only ſignifies <hi>ſhort Wind,</hi> but threatens the <hi>Glaunders, Strargles,</hi> and other Diſeaſes incident to ſtraitneſs and purſiveneſs; and more particularly dangerous <hi>Colds</hi> of many natures.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:110035:35"/>
               <p>If it happen the Jaws be ſo ſtrait, that the Neck ſwell over them as it were; yet if it be occaſioned by no diſtemper, it matters not much as to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Horſe, though it is very unſeemly; but if it ſwell out long, and end taper, then the Horſe may be ſubject to the <hi>Vives,</hi> Tumours, Impoſthumes, or the like: Then obſerve that his Noſtrils be wide, large, open and dry, and that the Redneſs naturally appears without any forcing or ſtraining: If the Lips are even, the Mouth deep, and the Muzzle ſmall, they ſignifie good wind, ſpeed and courage; but if on the contrary, dullneſs and infirmity; as alſo by the ſhortneſs of the upper Lip, and wrinkles on the ſide of the Mouth old age; and above all, obſerve his Teeth be clean, even, firm, and well proportioned. But of them more particularly hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the Horſe's Age, though in general, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly and uneven Teeth are a ſign of badneſs.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the Breaſt of your Horſe; and if it appear broad, bowing outward and well feather'd, it denotes health and ſtrength; when, on the contrary, a ſmall Breaſt ridged or flat; as alſo the Shoulders ſtanding in, denotes ſtoppage, weakneſs in travel, pains of the Heart and Liver, and the like, with ſtumbling and interfering; as alſo does a Breaſt that is narrow and imbowed inward, thoſe being generally the marks of a Horſe, weak and unfit for labour.</p>
               <p>Next caſt your Eyes from the Elbow to the Knee, and ſee his fore-thighs be well proportioned, ſtrait and well clad, with fleſh and ſinews; by which ſtrength is ſignified, and by the contrary weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the Knees, that they are carried even, that they be well joynted, cloſe knit and fixed, with Sinews and Ligaments free from Scabs or Scars, not over round, but well joynted and boned; for if they appear contrary to theſe marks as round, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a more than ordinary bigneſs; if they be ſcabbed, broken, or the hair off, then it betokens an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110035:36"/>uneven treader, and one that is apt to ſtumble, or ſubject to the ſwift cutt.</p>
               <p>Having thus far taken notice, the next thing to be obſerved materially, is from the Knee to the Paſterns; and there conſider, if the Legs be clean, well fleſhed and well ſinewed, bowing ſomewhat inward, which ſhews ſtrength and a firm treader; but if on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide you find any fleſhy Excreſſences or Scabs a little beneath the Knee on the inſide, likewiſe then is the Horſe ſubject to interfering; but if a general Scab, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the cauſe is foul keeping; if on the inner bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Knee you perceive Seams, or the hair broke diſorderly, a cankerous Mallender is denoted, or Ulcer.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that the Paſterns be clean and well knit together, eſpecially the firſt, and the other ſhort and ſtrong, ſtanding upright; if the firſt be large or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then is the Horſe frequently ſubject to the Sinew, ſtrain and twitching girds; or if the other be weak or bending, it will hardly ſupport the body in any long Journey or uneaſie way.</p>
               <p>As for a good hoof, it ought to be black, tough, and much inclining to roundneſs; for a long, white, rough or brittle hoof, denotes an uneven tread, a tripping or looſing the Shooe upon every occaſion, and is altogether unſeemly, and fore-ſhews the Horſe ſubject to foundering: As for the Crownet of the hoof, obſerve if the fleſh ſwell a little, and that the hair lye decently and in good order, that no Scabs nor boney Excreſſences happen there; for if thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ten to one but the Ring-bone will afflict it.</p>
               <p>Thus having obſerved your Horſe in the front, place your ſelf on the right ſide of him, and obſerve that his head be neither too high nor too low; that his neck at the ſetting on be ſmall, and indifferently long, growing deeper by degrees, till it arrive at the moulder; Then for the Creſt, let it be high, ſtrong,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110035:36"/>and ſomewhat thin; his Mane ſomewhat curling, thin, long and ſoft. Theſe are not only ſigns of a good Horſe, but a Beauty alſo; and conſequently the contrary of deformity.</p>
               <p>In the next place have a regard to the Chine of his Back, that he have a due proportion of even, broad and ſtrait; his Ribs ſomewhat large, and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outwards like a bow; his Fillets ſhort, ſtrong and upright, about four fingers diſtance from his laſt Rib and his huckle-bone; his Body being well let down, yet hidden as it were within his Ribs; his Stones round and even hanging; and theſe are marks of beauty and perfection: Whereas, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a narrow Chine will ſubject the Saddle to wound the Horſe, and bending or Saddle-back'd denotes weakneſs; to have the Ribs over fat, makes the Horſe breathe painfully, when hard laboured. If his Fillets hang long and thin, they denote him weak, and not capable of performing a Journey in a hilly Country; and if his Stones hang down, as in long bags or purſes, uneven and unſeemly, it denotes a defect in nature, occaſioned either by ſickneſs or a feeble conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As for his Buttocks, note that they be round, full and plump, and that the Tail be well ſet on, the beſt obſervance being the evenneſs of the Buttocks with the Body; and that although they are ſomething long, that they ſpread well behind, and are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to make a ridge of the Crupper-bone, nor ſtand long and narrow; for in ſuch caſes neither a Pillion nor Pad-ſaddle can ſit eaſie nor conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>The hinder Thighs, commonly called Gaſcoins, are likewiſe to be regarded; and the obſervation is, that they be well let down in an evenneſs to the middle joynt, thick, brawney, full and ſwelling, by which ſtrength and goodneſs are to be obſerved; whereas a lean and lank Thigh, not will griſted, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110035:37"/>very ſlender, denotes weakneſs: Then obſerve the middle joynt behind, and ſee that it be ſomewhat lean, well knit and ligamented, and Sinews well vein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and moderately bending, which ſhews perfection in that part; but if it have any Chops or Sores in the inward bending, then it threatens a Sellender; and if it have a general ſwelling, then ſome blow or bruiſe has happened again; if the ſwelling be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the pot or hollow part, or on the inſide, and there it happen the Vein be full and proud, and the ſwelling moreover ſhort, then is it the blood-ſpavin; if hard, the Bone-ſpavin; but if it happen behind, on the Knuckle, then is it a Kerb or Curb.</p>
               <p>After this look on the hinder Legs, obſerving whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are clean, well fleſhed, and ſupported with Sinews: If ſo, it is a good ſign; but if they be fat, they will not endure labour; and if they ſwell, it is a ſign the greaſe is molten in the body of the Horſe, and that he is foul: If ſcabbed above the Paſterns, then beware the Scratches; if under the Paſterns, Chaps appear, then it is the Pains: All which are infectious and dangerous to the Horſe, and render him far from being good.</p>
               <p>As for the Tail, it ſeldom ſits amiſs upon a good pair of Buttocks; and, on the contrary, never well upon ill ones; but the beſt ſetting on is broad, high and flat, a little couched inward. And theſe Rules for knowing and chuſing a good Horſe, may generally and particularly ſuffice, though in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel many more will occur.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TO know the Age of a Horſe, there are ſundry things and matters to be obſerved beſides his Teeth, though by them moſt take their Rules, though not altogether infallible; yet that nothing may be wanting on this occaſion, I ſhall deliberately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Particulars, beginning with the Teeth, the better to comply with cuſtome.</p>
               <p>The full number of a Horſe's Teeth are computed forty, and ſeldom, when he has all that he will have, prove leſs: And thus they are diſtinguiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> On either ſide, above and beneath ſix great wang Teeth, which compute at twenty four, generally termed Grinders; Then ſix above, and the like number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in the fore part of his Mouth, which, with the other, make thirty ſix, theſe latter being properly called Geatherers: and moreover four Tuſhes, two above, and the like number below, generally called Bite-teeth: And from theſe the Conſiderations are as follow.</p>
               <p>In the firſt year only the Grinders and Geatherers, commonly called Colts-teeth, only appear ſmall, white and ſmooth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond year two of thoſe Teeth are changed in the middle of the Geatherers, <hi>viz.</hi> one above, and another below; and as for thoſe that come up in the room of the ſhead ones, they are generally darker or

               <p>The third year, the next to thoſe before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are changed, leaving the reſt to be changed the ſucceſſive years, ſo that after the fifth year no Colts-teeth, and then likewiſe his Tuſhes are compleat; and thoſe that ſucceed the laſt Foal's Teeth will be hollow, having in the midſt of them ſmall black ſpecks, of which many take ſingular notice, ſhaping their Judgment thereby; though if they take not heed, they may be impoſed upon by Artificial as well as Natural ſpecks or ſpots, though indeed by theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spots a Horſe's Age may be known till eight years are paſt, and no longer.</p>
               <p>The ſixth year being come, his new Tuſhes ariſe at the bottom, of which young fleſh will appear, the Tuſhes being ſmall, white, ſhort and ſharp, and ſo continue to the ſeventh year; in which year they are of full growth, and the Mark very plain to be ſeen and obſerved.</p>
               <p>The eighth year all the Teeth will appear plain and ſmooth, but the Specks, generally called the Marks, will decreaſe by degrees, till they are ſeen no more, ending as it were with or before this year; nor will the Tuſhes continue longer white, but incline to a yellowiſh.</p>
               <p>The ninth year being come, and the Mark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no more to be ſeen, conſider the fore-teeth will be broader and longer than uſual, their Colour inclining to a yellowiſh paleneſs, and the Tuſhes to bluntneſs.</p>
               <p>The tenth years age may be known by the filling up of the holes within ſide the Tuſhes, which were before like cells or hollow pits; as alſo his Temples will be crooked or diſtorted.</p>
               <p>The Horſe being arrived at the eleventh year of his age, the moſt material thing to be known by the Teeth is their diſtortion, yellow colour and unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110035:38"/>as alſo their more than ordinary length. Now as for the twelfth, and generally held to be the laſt year a Horſe's Age can be known by the Teeth, your obſervation muſt be taken from their largeneſs, foulneſs, and hanging over each other; and though ſome have held that by the cloſe wearing of his Tuſhes to the chops, his Age may be further known; yet let me adviſe the Buyer, that he may be deceived therein, that, being no certain Rule or Mark, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to rely on. And thus much as to what relates to the knowing a Horſe's Age by the Teeth; from whence I proceed to his Mouth in general: And that which I infer from thence is this.</p>
               <p>If upon having regard to a Horſe you perceive his Teeth and Lips hang over, uneven or unpleaſant, unleſs it proceed from ſome diſtemper in the Head, or diſorder in the Body, then is that Horſe old.</p>
               <p>Obſerve you find not too deep a burning for the <hi>Lampus,</hi> that ſo the Provender may be apt to ſtick therein to his hindrance in feeding; and that the ſpaces between the barrs are not too deep and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of themſelves, for that denotes Age, but that they be pleaſantly fixed, ſmooth and ſoft.</p>
               <p>As the Eyes are, if ſprightly and well fixed, a great ornament to the Horſe, ſo if other ways, they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him uncomely and deformed; Wherefore the defects ought to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> If upon view you perceive the Eyes to be ſunk, dim or hollow-pitted, the Temples crooked or wrinkled, then old Age is ſignified: But if the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> If the pits be full, the Eyes lively, bright and ſparkling, the Temples ſtrait and ſmooth, then is the Horſe young.</p>
               <p>If you miſtruſt a Horſe's Age, and cannot well find it according to the former directions, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your feeling to the Tail; and if there you find two knobs near the Setting-on, each about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Musket-bullet, then you may conclude your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110035:39"/>Horſe to be very young; but if the Joynt thereabout be plain and ſmooth, no ſuch ſign or token appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then conclude him to have paſſed the tenth year; and ſo by thoſe knobs, proportionable to the bigneſs, conſider his years.</p>
               <p>Other Conſiderations there are to be had from the Hair and Skin, as if you perceive any Hairs that are griſly about the Eye-brows, eſpecially if the Horſe be of a dark or contrary colour; or if ſuch be found underneath, the main Age thereby is ſignified: The like if a white Horſe, or one very light-coloured, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to have black or red Mannals. As to what is to be obſerved from the Skin, let this be a Rule: If the Horſe be old, the Skin you raiſe between your thumb and finger will ſtand in a pucker, and not ſuddainly return to its place: But if young, it will fall flat almoſt as ſoon as let go. Nor is the Hoof to be altogether neglected in this caſe; for if you caſt your Eyes upon a Horſe whoſe Hoofs are crink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſeamed, rough or unſeemly; or if they be brittle, and ſubject to break or crumble, then is the Horſe old or infirm. And thus much may ſuffice as to Age, unleſs ſomewhat that will occur by the way in handling other matters of the like nature.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> How exactly to know the ſtate or condition of a Horſe's Body, relating to Fatneſs or Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Health or Sickneſs; with many other things worthy of note.</head>
               <p>Having bred up or purchaſed a good Horſe, there is nothing more neceſſary than to keep him well; but eſpecially look narrowly to the ſtate of his Body; ſo well informing your Judgment in the ſymptoms of Diſeaſes, as at all times to be able to diſcover the leaſt defect as to what relates to his health, or hinders his flouriſhing: And the better to enable ſuch as are minded to turn their Studies this way, I ſhall lay down ſuch Rules as have upon all, or moſt emergent occaſions, proved effectual: which take as followeth.</p>
               <p>If you find your Horſe in a drooping condition, if he refuſe his Meat, and be heavy or dull-eyed, ſeem uneaſie, ſtanding, or reſtleſs lying down, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſome inward grief or defect afflicts him, not to be ſo eaſily diſcovered as ſome have conjectured. Wherefore I ſhall firſt point my Directions at the ſtate of a Horſe's Body in General, and from thence to Particulars; beginning, the better to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an inſight into the reſt, with the ſtrong Eſtate or healthfull Conſtitution of a Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for ſome Horſes, though they are in health and good temper, yet by reaſon of their roundneſs and well-compacted body, the Buyer may have a lean one put upon him inſtead of fat one, unleſs he be skilfull in handling and trying, thereby to diſcover his want
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110035:40"/>of fleſh or feeble conſtitution; and ſo a Horſe that is long and full-made may ſeem lean to the Eye at a diſtance, when really he is in good caſe; or a fat Horſe may likewiſe deceive the expectation of the Buyer, by having contracted inward fatneſs and foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which will require time and labour to avoid and bring away; when, on the contrary, ſome Horſes will be fat without, and in good caſe, yet be clean within, and free from groſs humours; and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though outwardly appearing lean, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly groſs and foul; and theſe proceed from the Order and Conſtitution of the Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is to be known upon ſearch, by demonſtration, ſundry ways, as to what is outwardly to be taken notice of.</p>
               <p>Firſt feel the Horſe's Body in all the advantageous places, but eſpecially upon the Ribs; and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if you perceive a general ſoftneſs of the fleſh or looſeneſs, ſo that your fingers eaſily ſink into it, then conclude a foulneſs within; or if it be hard and firm upon all but the hindmoſt Ribs, then ſuſpect Molten-greaſe within, which muſt be voided by Purging or Scowring, though at the ſame time the Horſe appear poor and lean, or elſe he cannot well be reduced to a good ſtate of body; and the better to make the potions opperate, is to prepare him for them by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, that being moved and ſtirred, it may the eaſier be brought away.</p>
               <p>If ſo it happen, as has in ſome manner been ſaid, that the Horſe appear ſo fat and thick, that the ſpace between his Chaps is as it were cloſed up, or the Jaws upon handling prove fleſhy and full, then much foulneſs in head and body is ſignified; but if upon handling he happen to be thin and clean, though ſome hard knobs or kernels be contracted, yet that may rather proceed from a cold taken, than from foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to come to Particulars.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:110035:40"/>
               <p>If the Horſe's Dung appear of a pale, whitiſh, yellow Colour, not too hard, yet ſo that in falling at only flats a little, but does not break in ſunder nor crumble, and be not of a rank noiſome ſcent, then is the Body of the Horſe free from inward foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but on the contrary, if it be of a black or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nuddy colour, hard like pellets, yet hot and greaſy, it betokens foul feeding, and a neglect in the keeper of not giving him a due proportion of Corn, but rather feeding him with Hay in over-abundance, or ſuffering him to feed foul by eating his Litter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> denoting he has likewiſe Molten-greaſe within him that cannot come away without ſome Artificial helps. If the Dung be of a reddiſh colour, and hard, it ſignifies the Horſe has been over-heated or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and therefore ought to have a Clyſter of cooling Simples to cool and open his Body, thereby preventing Sickneſs, or at leaſt Coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>If the Urin be of an Amber colour, ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to thickneſs, of a ſtrong, yet not offenſive ſcent, then it denotes a healthfull conſtitution; but if it be ruddy or high-coloured, hot and ſcalding, ſo that the Horſe makes water with pain, or does it by degrees, then has the Horſe taken hurt by being over-heated, or in being ridden too ſoon upon being taken up from Graſs: If ſo it happen the Urin be of a high colour, yet very clear, like Beer well ſettled, then is it occaſioned by Heat or Inflamation, cauſed by a ſurfeit.</p>
               <p>If a white film or ſcum happen to be upon the Urin after ſettlement, it denotes the Horſe weakned by too much Venery; and a Mare by too often Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, too furious a Luſt, and conſequently not very fit for ſervice, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the back. Green Urin denotes a Conſumption of the Body; and that with bloody ſtreaks or ſpecks, not much unlike to a mattery ſubſtance, denotes an Ulcer, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110035:41"/>the like defect, in the Kidneys: And further, a Lead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> coloured, groſs and cloudy Urin, denotes a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſickneſs, if not Death it ſelf. And thus much as to what is to be known in relation to Health and Sickneſs by theſe Excrements.</p>
               <p>And now let us conſider a little if a Horſe be out of order, how thoſe that attend him ought to carry themſelves towards him in relation to his Diet.</p>
               <p>Let him obſerve in this caſe the diſpoſition of the Horſe, and not violently thruſt or intrude the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender upon him, but conſider to give him what h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> beſt likes, and that at leaſure and by degrees, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with mildneſs and ſweet behaviour; and bewaring, above all things, not to give him any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, encreaſing the quantity as you perceive him deſirous to take it, giving him white Water to drink and ply him, as you ſee occaſion, with warm Maſhes warming his Water with a little Bran duſted over it if the weather be cold; and be ſure to ſuffer him to be in a warm Stable, with clean Litter and good Dreſſing.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe be any ways ſubject to Lameneſs, beware in your Courſings or Heats you avoid craggy or ſtoney Ground, or forcing him too much againſt a Hill. Other things there are to be obſerved of this or the like kind, relating to the ſtate of a Horſe's Body, as to the knowing by ſundry other matters and tokens: But as for them, I refer you to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Privy-parts of a Horſe, as to ſickneſs and health, are much to be obſerved; and this eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice to be taken, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he be a Stone-horſe, his Cods hang even, and his Stones well truſſed up, firm and round, which ſhews him in good heart, and fit for buſineſs; when, on the contrary, if they hang long, or bagging down, a weak conſtitution is thereby implied: Nor is it leſs to be obſerved by the Yard of a Gelding, or Shape of a Mare. But, for brevities ſake, waving further Particulars, I ſhall proceed to take Obſervations from the Limbs, and what, in caſe of defect, ought to be done on that occaſion.</p>
               <p>In caſe you intend to Run or Travel your Horſe, if you find his Limbs ſtiff, or not ſo plyable as you would have them, or as ordinarily they happen to be; Then to render them ſupple and plyant, Melt Hog's-greaſe and Oyl of Chamomile, and dipping a Wollen-cloth hot into the Liquids, anoint or bathe therewith the Legs or Thighs from above the Knee, and from the Cambrels downwards; or, for want of theſe, Neats-foot Oyl; after which chafe it in with your hands; and in often ſo doing in all places where you ſee occaſion, you will wonderfully reſtore his Limbs, rendring them ſupple and plyable.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:110035:42"/>
               <p>There are many things to be obſerved from the Sweating of a Horſe, eſpecially from that which proceeeds without External force, occaſioned by hard labour, or the like; for then is the Horſe faint, foul fed, or wanteth Exerciſe to evaporate the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of watery humours which he hath contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And eſpecially this is to be noted, when his Sweat is white and frothy, like a Lather of Soap; but in caſe of Heats, and other conſiderable labour to create Sweat; if it appear black and pearly, like clear water, then is the Horſe in a good plight o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> habit of Body, eſpecially if he be lively and brisk, not in the leaſt afflicted with any ſhaking or trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, for that infers the Sweat forced out by ſome Internal diſorder, rather than naturally evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>And now ſeeing the Cauſes of Sickneſs are very material to be known, that is, from whence they ariſe, that ſo the Skill in Curing may be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Remedies to be applied more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and certain in their Operation; as alſo the cauſes of health and long life.

               </head>
               <p>CErtain it is, that no Man can truly pretend to Experience of this kind, unleſs he duly weigh the Nature of Generation and Corruption, for on them, as on the Collumns of this Art, ſtand what is material of this kind. Theſe two being ever conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the main, though one Horſe's body may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Conſtitution from the other; for theſe being the Suparlative of Elementary ſubſiſtance or matter, fail not to operate in their turns, or as Nature diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them in their places and degrees; and therefore it will be highly convenient to diſcover them in their Parts and Particles.</p>
               <p>As for the Body of a Horſe, it differs not in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary compoſition from that of a Man; for of all the Elements it conſiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Air, Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which are indeed the Generatives and Conſumers of all Mortal things and beings: And although theſe Elements are different in themſelves, yet are frequently agreeable in the Compoſition; for the Fire, though hot and dry in it ſelf, yet compounded with the other Elements in a Mortal frame, or bodily compoſition, diffuſes a gentle heat to nouriſh and ſupport life. Though the Air is hot and moiſt, but more partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of the latter, yet does it temperate the heat of the former, and gives a kind reſpiration and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110035:43"/>breathing to refreſh and exhilerate each Part and Particle. The Earth, though it is in it ſelf groſs and ponderous, yet in this compoſition is it rarified, and by its ſubſtantial matter compoſes the frame wherein the reſt of the Elements cohabit; and being cold and dry, ſerves to temperate the hot and moiſt. The Water, though cold and moiſt in it ſelf, ſerves in this caſe to moiſten and render plyable the Sublunar works of Nature, and enabling them to ſubſiſt: And of theſe four, Mothers of Creation participate more immediately the four humours, of which the Bodies of Animal and Rational Creatures are compoſed, as <hi>Choler, Blood, Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Phlegm;</hi> the firſt of Fire, the ſecond of Air, the third of Earth, and the fourth to Water. And as theſe more or leſs operate, ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their qualities, is the Body moved and expoſed to heat, cold, moiſture or dryneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the effects they produce; for theſe have their principal Dominion in the Seats of Life, and from thence extend their power and force to every part and member. As thus <hi>Phlegm</hi> poſſeſſes the Brain, <hi>Choler</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> the Liver and Heart, and <hi>Melancholy</hi> the Spleen, which is the Recepticle and Conveyancer of the Excrements of the Liver, all of them having diſtinctly and conjunctly their proper office aſſigned. As thus the Blood is the principal nouriſher of the natural frame, Phlegm or Moiſture renders the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers flexible and complyant in motion and uſe. Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler cauſeth digeſtion by its Operative heat; and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy diſpoſes to an Appetite, and attracteth the groſſer parts of Nutrimental Elements, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the disburthening of Nature.</p>
               <p>It is generally agreed on by the Learned, That every Organical-body is ſupported by four principal inſtrumental Members; and theſe are held to be the <hi>Brain, Heart, Liver</hi> and <hi>Genitors,</hi> theſe performing their particular offices and functions: Por as the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news are ſupported by the Brain, the ſeat of Animal
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110035:43"/>Spirits; the Arteries from the Heart, or ſeat of Vital Spirits; the Veins, which are natural parts, from the Liver; ſo the Seminal Veſſels are ſupported by the Genital Parts or Inſtruments of Generation; and theſe conjoyntly operating, are the Elementary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, as participating of their Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Materials of Generation.</p>
               <p>Thus having briefly diſcourſed of the Elementary parts of the Bodies of Creatures, I now proceed from the four Humours, Elements and Inſtrumental Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to the Natural faculties; which in this caſe are the next things to be conſidered, which are Eating, Retaining, Concocting and Expelling; and though all the Humours are Inſtrumental in promoting theſe, yet principally Nature ſerves her ſelf but of only one to work upon, and that is a wheyiſh kind of Blood, generated in the Liver, or attracted thereby from the pureſt part of ſuch nutriment as has been concocted in the ſtomach, and from thence conveying it ſelf to the Liver, and through the great Vein, conveying nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment into all its branches, and conſequently into all the parts of the Body, by diſperſing the Rarified blood into every part, which, by the help of the other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, ſupports the frame of Nature. As for the watery part of nouriſhment, and that of the groſſer ſubſtance; the one is carried into the Bladder, and the other paſſing into the Bowels, are in the end caſt out of the Body to make room for more of the like nature. But moreover, there are two Veins that conduct part of the pureſt and rarified matter into the Seminal Veſſels, where, by the operation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of the Generative parts, it is refined by a gentle heat to a more ſpirituous quality, and ſo in the end becomes Seed, which, according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or badneſs mixed in the Womb, proves effectual or ineffectual; for note, that if the thin and ſubtil Blood be wanting to ſupport the Seed, and enliven it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110035:44"/>with heat, it frequently fails in performing its office, and the Horſe becomes frigid and uncapable of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and is often ſubject to moiſt diſeaſes; as the Glaunders often proceeding from the Liver and Lungs when they are infected with putrefaction, occaſioned by moiſt Rheums, and other indigeſted Moiſtures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending on them, or Inflamations occaſioned by Lumps, Knots or Kernels under the Chaul, proceeding from cold or immoderate labour, and many times the Mourning of the Chine by a Horſe's immoderate Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mare, or over-ſtraining himſelf in the action: And this may likewiſe happen by his eating too much raw meat, or drinking upon a ſuddain heat, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ways; which, when I come to treat of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I ſhall largely diſcourſe on. But firſt, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proceed to let you know how. Horſes ought to be uſed, to prevent their contracting Diſeaſes, as much as in the ſuperficial Schemes of Art the greateſt Artiſts of this kind have allowed; and the means are chiefly five, as Cleanſing, Blood-letting, Purging, Sweating and Vomiting.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe may be ſaid to be twofold, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward; the firſt being by cleanſing his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Parts by care and good dreſſing, which ought the more diligently to be obſerved upon his being taken up from Graſs; and the time limited for that, by the curious, is <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-tide, for then the heart of the Graſs beginneth to decline. And this may be done in the manner which I have often recited in what relates to Dreſſing; nor is it at all inconſiſtent with Reaſon, that the cleanſing the Skin from duſt and dirt, and looſening it in every part by gentle rubbing, ſhould enliven the Horſe, and render him more ſprightly; ſo that Nature having her free courſe and progreſs without reſtraint, may opperate in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing kind refreſhment to every part, and keep thoſe groſs humours from ſetling, that are frequently the origi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110035:44"/>happen that your Horſe be mirey and foul, then may you uſe Fulling-earth, Soap, and other ſcowring Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, eſpecially with warm Water; but then having an eſpecial care he catch not cold thereupon, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him warm, and well drying him till he be thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold; and in ſo doing you will prevent thoſe moiſt Diſeaſes wherewith he is otherwiſe afflicted: And the better to effect this, cut away all the ſuperfluous hairs that any way anoy the body, or other parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo being ſhooed and neatly dreſſed, I leave him to the Second Part, which conſiſts in the Internal clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and purging Directions; for which, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more immediate or particular Directions, take in the following Chapter.</p>

               <p>THough I have named what I intend to propoſe in the foregoing Pages; yet let not the Reader, conſidering the conſequence and validity of what I ſhall here propoſe, think it amiſs that I ſelect a Chapter for no other purpoſe; and that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may neither be delayed, nor appear ſmall in the Eyes of the Reader or Practitioner, take a proſpect of it in the following Directions.</p>
               <p>As for inward Purging, the meaſures ought to be taken from the temperature of the Horſe's body, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110035:45"/>more eſpecially in caſe of his retirement at ſuch a time, that no hard labour or immoderate exerciſe has been impoſed on him: And in this caſe, if you find him coſtive, or that in caſe of Evacuation, nature help not, as in uſual caſes, let ſome one with a ſmall Arm penetrate his Fundament, and draw thence the Dung that obſtructs, or at leaſt clogs the fluent or natural paſſage, that ſo both the natural and artificial Motions and Cauſes proceeding from Drugs, or compoſition of Purgation, may opperate and perfect their intended deſign, and may be beſt adminiſtred Clyſter-wiſe: But then conſider the conſtitution of your Horſe; If he be fat, and ſomewhat inclining to foulneſs, it muſt be a ſtrong potion that will effectually opperate; but not ſo if the Horſe be weak and melancholy. But waving 'em here, I ſhall ſpeak more particularly of them in due place; as alſo of Drinks which ought to be made, and ſeaſonably given for the preventing ſickneſs, and preſervation of health; and if you find the Blood coagulated, which may be perceived by the trembling of the Veins, and the working of it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then it is requiſite to let him Blood, and give him a gentle Vomit to carry the foulneſs from off the ſtomach, that may be the occaſion of bad digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently of the naughtineſs of the Blood; Dieting him with Maſhes and fine Provender, from which may ſpring ſuch wholſome nutriment, as may create a thin and airy Blood; rubbing and often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing his Body with Hogs Lard, or Ointment of Marſhmallows. And now to be ſatisfied what things moſtly contribute to health, take the following Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Learned, <hi>viz.</hi> A good natural conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, good digeſtion, good nouriſhment, moderation in feeding and diet, moderation in labour and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, moderation in leaping Mares. Again, wholſome Airs, not laboured too ſoon after Graſs, to be kept from raw Meats, not to drink nor eat being hot, ever obſerving to walk him at the end of any Journey, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110035:45"/>not to Phyſick him unleſs you find occaſion. And theſe obſervances being the occaſion of long life, I ſhall endeavour, for the better ſatisfaction of the Reader, more fully to demonſtrate them.</p>
               <p>As for Nature, good Digeſtion, and ſound Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ought to be conſonant, and indeed they are well proportioned, when neither the moiſture with its humidity is not ſo predominant as to quench and over-power the heat, nor the extraordinary heat too ſuddainly conſume the moiſture, though of neceſſity the latter muſt be of force above the former, or elſe Digeſtion cannot be perfected as it ought; and in that caſe ſeaſonable nouriſhment muſt conſequently fail.</p>
               <p>Moderation in Eating is another main cauſe of long life, as immoderate Eating is of a ſhort one: For as exceſs in Eating, though the Provender be never ſo good and wholſome, obſtructs good digeſtion, and contracts crudities with a bad habit of ſtomach; ſo on the contrary, ſpare Diet weakens and decays Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and infeebles the natural powers and faculties of Life, giving the heat by that means a power ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to ſubdue and conquer the Radical moiſture, and gives Diſeaſes an opportunity to break in upon the infeebled body, which prove many times too hard for the Farrier; for in all Creatures obſerve, that the weaker Nature is, the ſtronger is the diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe of health and long life proceeds from moderate and kind labour, for by indifferent motion digeſtion is much forwarded, and the humours diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, being by that means prevented from ſetling more than is requiſite in any one place; beſides, it is the cauſe that Excrements are ſooner voided, which by lying long in the body might occaſion ſickneſs. And further obſerve, that he be not laboured upon a full ſtomach, ſo as by over-ſtraining, digeſtion may be hindred, which ſhould turn to nutriment; and lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Diſeaſes by indigeſted Crudities, being too
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110035:46"/>ſuddainly drawn into the Veins, and by that means diſperſed into all parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe there is of the like nature that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the moderateneſs of ſleeping and waking, for too much waking is an enemy to health, by ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vital ſpirits that ſhould ſupport and maintain life, and a decaying that moiſture that ſhould refreſh the ſeveral parts of the body, cauſing thereby Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Barrenneſs, a dulling of the Brain, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Lungs and Liver, whoſe offices it weakens by decaying the vigor in the performance; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this exceſſive ſleeping, dozes the brain, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders digeſtion, and obſtructs nature in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of her offices, contracting noxious vapours and a foulneſs of the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>Another thing to be conſidered is, that your Horſe be not admitted to ſpend himſelf too much upon Mares, becauſe ſuch immoderate exerciſe weakens the Brain, Back and Eyes, waſtes the Vital Spirits, and often ſhortens the days of many a brave Horſe; and therefore if you would have your Horſe laſt long, let him not cover above three or four Mares in a year at the moſt; or if your conveniency will not at all times admit you to keep him from them, then Geld him whilſt young; for it is ever obſerved, that a Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding lives longer naturally than a Stoned-horſe, and a Mule than them both, becauſe he is not ſubject to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>Wholſome Air, above all things, is to be choſen, for that rarifies the blood, helps digeſtion, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Vital ſpirits; when-as groſs Air or evil ſcents not only make the Horſe loath his Provender, but corrupt the Blood, and ſubject the whole body to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>Travelling after Graſs too ſoon, without purging and cleanſing the Horſe's body, cauſe the bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to incorporate, or by ſpreading themſelves, to afflict each part with pains and diſorders, reducing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110035:46"/>the Horſe to a dullneſs of temper and diſpoſition, and ſo raw meats engender raw flegmatick humours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the Stomach and Brain, occaſioning the Glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Coughs, Catarrhs, Stavers, Yellows, Anticors and Morfoundring, not only diſable the Horſe, but if neglected, become incurable but by death.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe there is, and that not to be lightly regarded, which is, not to ſuffer your Horſe to eat or drink when hot, and to ſtand thereon, for by ſo doing the Blood will corrupt and putrifie, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Surfeits, Feavers, Obſtructions, and many the like Maladies and Grievances frequently occaſioning death: But as ſoon as you bring him home in that condition, put him into a warm Stable without waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Rub, or cauſe him to be well rubbed down; Cloath him well, and let him have a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of warm Litter to ſtand on; and if he be ſubject to eat it, put on his Muzzle, and ſo let him ſtand an hour or more till his greaſe be ſufficiently cooled, and you'l find him in a fit condition to give him his Provender: And laſtly, that he may be well breathed, and ſound winded thereby, being enabled to hold out as occaſion ſhall require, you may at ſeaſonable times mix with his Provender the Powder of theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seeds and Drugs, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> Cummin and Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, Powder of Licoris and Ellecampane-Roots, Farberries, Brimſtone, Flower, and the Roots of white Lillies, Hyſop, Horehound, Savin, Coltsfoot, the Seeds of Marſhmallows, Rue, and <hi>Polipodium</hi> of the Oak, and any of the like quality that will occaſion good Wind, and prevent Infections, purifie the Blood, and help the Liver in the performance of its office, that is, to rarifie the nutriment by a good digeſtion; but you muſt not mix over-much at a time, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when you firſt begin it, leaſt he take diſguſt at the ſcent or taſte, and ſo reject his Provender; but increaſe the quantity by degrees, not giving him any above twice a week, and then let it be Morning and Evening.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> An exact Deſcription of the Veins of a Horſe, how ſcituate in the Body; as alſo of Blood-letting; and how, and upon what account of Sickneſs, or other defect, they are to be opened, for the prevention of death or danger.</head>
               <p>HAving thus far diſcourſed in Generals and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of what relates to a good Horſe or Mare of any ſort or kind, that thereby the Reader might inſtruct himſelf; I ſhall proceed to what yet remains material to be known, eſpecially to Farriers, and ſuch who undertake the Cure of Horſes; which is to give an account of the ſeveral parts of the Body, ſo as they may be diſtinguiſhed as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but eſpecially of ſuch parts as ſhall be found moſt uſefull on immergent matters, and the Veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pipes or conduits that carry off Blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently nutriment to all parts of the Body; I think it highly convenient to ſay ſomething in the firſt place of them.</p>
               <p>From the Liver note there ariſeth one large Vein, which, like a conduit, ſupplies the reſt of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are many in number, and ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves throughout the Body like little Rivolets or ſtreams: And of theſe, two material ones are found in the Palate of the Mouth, above the firſt and third Barrs, which ought to be opened by a diſcreet Farrier, when the Horſe is afflicted with any Malignant pain, or diſeaſe in the Head or Stomach. Two more there are that deſcending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which from the lower part of the Eyes, deſcend to the Noſtrils, and are beſt opened when the Eyes are afflicted with any diſtemper or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110035:47"/>grievance. Two others there are above his Eyes, which are called Temple-Veins, becauſe they run croſs the Temples; and theſe are generally opened for cold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in the Head. Two great ones there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that run along the Wind-pipe, by the ſides of it, from the uppermoſt Joynt of his Chaps, to the Breaſt, commonly called Neck-Veins; and theſe are opened for ſundry diſeaſes, being the moſt uſual Veins that are opened. There are two other Veins that ariſe from between the fore-legs, and are called Breaſt-Veins, becauſe they end on the top of the Breaſt; and theſe are opened in caſe of Surfeits, Feavers, or Heart-ſickneſs. Two others there are which aſcend from the fore-legs, but riſe not ſo high as thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; and theſe reſt upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bough of the fore-leg, and are generally called Plat-Veins; and are opened in caſe of Founder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any other grief or grievance in the Legs or Limbs. Other two there are that paſs from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow of the fore-ſhoulder, down along the inſide of the fore-legs, being known by the name of Shank-Veins, which are generally opened in caſe of Splents, Spavins, Mallenders or Sallenders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then are there four Veins which run along the Fetlocks of the Horſe, known by the name of Shackle-Veins; and theſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are ſmall, are yet important ones, and by bleeding cure the ſtiffneſs of the Joynts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Foundering. Then are there four more about the Corronets in his Hoofs, called Corronet-Veins, and are opened for the Ring-bone and Surbating. In the Hoof are four more, which circle his Toes, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Toe-Veins; and are opened for fretting and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering. Two great Veins there are, that deſcending from his Stones, paſs along the inſide of his Thighs, to his Cambrels; and theſe are called Kidney-Veins, and are opened with ſucceſs for diſeaſes in the Reins and Kidneys. Two others there are which, deſcending from above the hinder Cambrils, paſs along on the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110035:48"/>inſide of the hinder-legs, down to the Fetlocks, being called the Spavin-Veins, and are ſeldom opened, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in caſe of the Blood-ſpavin. Two Veins are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe found in his Flanks, from whence they take their denomination, and are opened ſucceſsfully for any pain or grief in the Fillets or Reins. Two Veins he has in his Haunches, called by the name of Haunch-Veins, and are opened in caſe of falling away, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Fleſh, Hideboundneſs, or the like. Two there are that run along the ſide of the Belly, from the Elbow to the Flank, and are called Spur-Veins; and in caſe of fretting, belly-foundring, ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, feſtring, or ſwelling of the belly or flank, they are opened with ſucceſs. In his Tail is one ſingle Vein, called the Tail-Vein, which is opened in caſe of ſheading the Hair; ſo that in all there are found, as a compleat number of principal Veins, or as from which Blood is taken on ſundry occaſions, thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in knowing which, any Man may underſtand how to let his Horſe blood, in caſe of the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Diſtempers, at ſuch times as a Farrier is not at hand. Many other ſmall Veins there are, but ſo inconſiderable to our purpoſe, that I ſhall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them in this place, but proceed to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Sinews: which is another Material part of this noble Creature, worthy to be inſpected.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SEeing the Sinews are the principal Ligaments that ſupport the frame of a Horſe's Body, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be known, in order to the remedying ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry griefs and diſorders, it will be highly neceſſary to ſpeak of them in their order, and eſpecially of ſo many of them as are the principal movers of the Body.</p>
               <p>As for the fountain or ſource from whence the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news ſpring, and by which they are nouriſhed, it is the Brain, for there paſſes through the hollow of the Neck one large Tendon or Sinew, which running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the back-bone, continues its courſe even to the end of the Tail: And from this proceeds two ſmall branches, which paſſing through the Scull, fall down along the Horſe's cheeks to the points of the Noſtrils. Two other branches there are which paſs through holes in the neither Chap, knitting it with the other, and ſo paſs along by the great Teeth, meeting juſt beneath the neither lip. Then are there twenty eight ſmall ſtrings, that running through the ſeven Bones that compoſe the Neck, knit them together; and paſſing from thence, uſe their office in knitting; likewiſe the Chine even to the Strunt. Then are there two great ones that ſtretch themſelves over the Spade-bones, and then dividing into divers branches, ſpread in a deſcending manner into the Legs, even
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110035:49"/>into the Hoofs, and in their progreſs knit every Joynt together. Beſides what I have named, there are two main Sinews coming through two holes to the flat bones of the Hips or Huckle; and from thence being divided into many branches, paſs down into the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-legs, even into the coffin of the Hoofs, binding all the Joynts firmly together. Now above all theſe, there is one main Sinew or Ligament proceeding from the ſetting-on of the Horſe's Neck, which paſſes along the Chine, and is one entire Sinew of near three inches broad, being in its nature flat, and not having any branch proceeding from it: And this is the great ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ener of the Back and Neck of any Horſe, and holdeth the Shoulder-blades firm; ſo that in all it is reckoned, a Horſe hath no leſs than thirty principal Sinews, whence a great number of other Sinews do proceed of leſſer note. But theſe which I have named are ſo uſefull in ſupporting the frame of the body, that if any one of them are afflicted, the Horſe will be much afflicted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now the next thing material to be known of this kind is the number of Bones, and their ſcituation; which, according to the beſt account that has been given, take as followeth.</p>
               <p>The full number of Bones found in the body of a Horſe are a hundred and ſeventy, <hi>viz.</hi> the upper part of the Head are computed two bones; from the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to the Noſe are two more; the neither Jaws are computed two Bones; the four Teeth are found to be twelve; the Tuſhes four, and the Grinders twenty four; the Bones in the Necks, from the Spade-bone to the Huckle-bone eight; from the Huckle-bones to the end of the Tail are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſeven: Next, or at leaſt next to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is a broad bone, in which are found twelve Seams or Joynts: Then the two Spade-bones, and after them the Forcales or Canale-bones, and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to theſe thoſe that are commonly called the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110035:49"/>Marrow-bones, and from thence to the Knees; two called the Thigh-bones, next to them two others, proceeding from thence to the Paſterns, called the Shank-bones, and ſo downward into the Hoof; other Bones, called the Supporters, in all ſixteen, though ſome of them are very ſmall. In the Breaſt there is a great Bone, whereunto thirty ſix Ribs, great and ſmall, are appendances; and to the Colume behind are afixed two Bones, and from the Molars to the Joynts you will find other two Bones, and two more towards the bending of the Ribs; from the bending of the Ribs, unto the Ribs, are two Bones, though very ſmall in compariſon of thoſe we account Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital ones; and from the Legs to the two Focils of the Legs, are to be found other two little Bones. And moreover obſerve, that from the Paſterns to the Hoof, and in the Hoof are ſixteen little Bones: All which are ruled and governed by Ligaments, and tends on to the beſt advantage or complacency in the frame of nature, and are neceſſary to be known as to the frame and ſtation wherein they reſide, or are ſcituate. From which I proceed to the Art of <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> or letting Blood, and the ſeaſons and diſtempers that require it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of Blood-letting in general; and how to know by ſundry ſigns and tokens the ſtate of a Horſe's Body; when and where it is convenient to let him Blood, for the preventing of Sickneſs, or recovery of Health.</head>
               <p>IN conſideration that Bleeding is held by many, and thoſe none of the worſt Experienced, to prevent diſtempers and diſorders in Horſes, if the times and ſeaſons are rightly obſerved, and the Diſeaſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what has been mentioned, I ſhall not fail to give Inſtructions of all kinds any way tending or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this matter, ſo far as may conſiſt with any purpoſe, or what thereby is intended to the good or advantage of a Horſe: And of theſe Directions in their order.</p>
               <p>To let a Horſe Blood too often, decays Nature, and much weakens the Horſe; when, on the other ſide, too long to defer it, gives corrupt Blood an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to create Diſeaſes that infect and afflict him; if it be done for healths ſake, without any ſign of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger, then is twice in a year ſufficient: The times beſt approved of for this office, are the end of <hi>December,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> Now ſome are of opinion, that there is no need of letting a Stone-horſe Blood, if he be uſed to cover Mares, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome diſeaſe be apparent; and the reaſon they give is, that his ſpending does exhauſt his Blood ſufficiently: But ſuch a reaſon is very weak, conſidering the Blood of which the Seed is made, by the working and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Genital Parts, is the moſt ſpirited, and and pure of all other; and that which ought to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110035:50"/>taken away by Blood-letting, is commonly the moſt groſs and offenſive, ſo that it will never turn to Seed, but corrupt by continuing in the Body, and create Diſeaſes; and therefore ought it to be drawn off, that the Veins being emptied, may fill with better Blood; nay, Blood-letting is coveted naturally by ſome Horſes; for the Horſes of <hi>Poland</hi> often let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves blood by often rubbing againſt a ſharp Poſt or Rock: And ſo does the River <hi>Horſe</hi> in <hi>Niius,</hi> from whoſe Example 'tis held, that Phlebotomy or Blood-letting came in uſe. Others there are that will not have Geldings let Blood; and the reaſon they give is, that his Body, through the loſs of his Genitors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infeebled, wants the Blood to ſupport and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate it; and that it conſumes faſter in him than in a Stone-horſe: But this bears no weight, for the Blood will increaſe according to the conſtitution of the Horſe and his feeding, and according to the heat or coldneſs of the Country the Horſe is bred in, the leſs or more Blood is found in him.</p>
               <p>The next Material matter to be regarded, is the exact time when it ought to be performed; and moſt hold it beſt in the Morning, when the Horſe is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an hour after he wakes or rouſes up: And then again have regard to the Moon, it being in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, if poſſible, but by no means in the Sign where the Vein is ſcituate that you open, leaſt thereby your Horſe be weakned, for then the Vital ſpirits will iſſue with the blood. And another regard is to be had to his Age; for if he be very old, you muſt not bleed him, unleſs upon ſome emergent occaſion, but ſuffer his Blood to nouriſh him, that his Fleſh may not wain or decreaſe. And in all theſe caſes you muſt have regard to a Horſe's conſtitution, for ſome are more capable of loſing three pound of Blood, than others are two or one; or in caſe of a Diſeaſe, according as more or leſs is required, as the Blood is more or leſs infected; and in ſuch a caſe no time nor ſeaſon is to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110035:51"/>be regarded, but as neceſſity requires; for many times Blood-letting in ſuch caſes is a means to ſave the Horſe, as deferring of it is to the deſtroying of him: And in theſe or the like caſes it ought to be known in what Diſeaſes it is requiſite, and that it may in the general be diſcovered by theſe Signs, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Horſe's Eyes look red, and his Veins riſe and ſwell beyond the ordinary bounds, then is he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with too much Blood, or at leaſt that which is not good. If you perceive by his Itching, ſcrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing himſelf, and uneaſineſs, that there is a ſalt firey humour contracted in the Veins, then let him Blood; which is more immediately known by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary itching of the Mane and Tail; by rubbing of which, the Hair frequently ſheds, and the Skin peels off. If his Urin be red and high-coloured, and his Dung very hot, black and hard. If on his Back there appear little Bubles or Inflamations red and angry; or if his Meat be not well digeſted, then they denote the Horſe to abound with Blood, and ſtand in need of having it drawn off to a degree, that his health may be preſerved or reſtored. If the Whites of his Eyes are tainted with yellowneſs, or the like happen to his upper or neither Lip, it is requiſite to bleed him, for upon the happening of any of theſe Signs the Blood is diſordered, ſuper-abundant or corrupted, and ſome fatal ſickneſs is threatned: To prevent, or at leaſt mittigate which, there is no better way than bleeding. And in the manner of letting Blood, when you have corded your Horſe conveniently, that the Veins may appear full and fair, you may ſtrike your Fleam in the Neck-Veins four Inches on this ſide the ſetting-on of the Head; but the other Veins being ſmall, you muſt open them with a Lancet, for fear of cutting them through, and ſo conſequently injure the Nerves that ſupport them. And thus much for Blood-letting, and the Signs of Bleeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110035:51"/>I ſhall proceed to what relates to Cures of all kinds, whether Internal Diſeaſes, or External Sorrances, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beſt and eaſieſt manner and method, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the approved Rules and Directions of the ableſt Farriers and Horſleeches that are, and have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred famous for their Skill, not only in this, but in divers other Nations; and withall let you plainly underſtand the cauſe of the moſt Chronical diſeaſes, as well as the means to Cure them, rendring the method and manner eaſie to the Practitioner, and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to thoſe that trade in Horſes, and keep them for their profit or pleaſure.

               </head>
               <p>MAny are the terms and names given to Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and Sorrances, and theſe frequently take their denomination from the place of their ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, relating to the parts of the Body, and chiefly ariſe or proceed from the evil ſtate or habit of the Body, and defect of the Members, eſpecially when there happens a looſning and diviſion of the Unity, or a Diſſonance in the temperature; and ſo we ſay when any diviſion or looſning happen in the Bone, it is a Fracture; if it happen in the Veins, it is a Rupture; and in the Fleſh a Wound or Ulcer; in the Sinews it is termed the Cramp or Convulſion; and in the Skin an Excoriation. And now obſerve, that in Cauterizing or Burning, which may be done two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways, <hi>viz.</hi> with hot Oyls or Water, or with a hot Iron; as alſo in making Inciſion, or the like, that they ever be done with caution above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Vein or Sinew, and never upon them, leaſt by the diſcommodity that may ariſe, the Horſe be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther damaged than furthered: And again, obſerve never to apply to Veins or Sinews any extraordinary Corroſives; and theſe we reckon ſo, are <hi>Arſnick, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate-Mercury, Reſalgar, Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol, Tartar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:110035:52"/>
               <p>In caſe of Cauterizing, ever obſerve rather to Launce with a hot Iron, than a cold one; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauterize than cut, becauſe by the heat the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are driven back, which would otherwiſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sore or Grief of long continuance; and by the product of a Sore in the Original, you may know the conſtitution of a Horſe; for if he be ſanguine, a whitiſh watery Excreſſence will flow of an indifferent thickneſs; if Cholerick, a thin ſalt one, inclining to greeniſh; if Flegmatick, a kind of a gellied-water; and if Melancholick, then a groſs blackiſh moiſture, attended by a dry Scab or Scurf.</p>
               <p>In caſe of Swelling or Tumors, it will be neceſſary with heed to mark the place they begin in, as alſo their progreſs and ending, that ſo the part of the body afflicted with bad humours may have Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſutable to remove them.</p>
               <p>Now if it ſo happen that the Swellings or Tumors be not upon any maſter Vein or Sinew, or too near the Vital parts, then may Repercuſſive Medicines be uſed: but if ſo, then thoſe that are mollifying, to raiſe it gently by degrees, that ſo being ripened, it may break of it ſelf; or if neceſſity require it, be Lanced, that the Corruption paſſing away, ſuch things may be applied, that with a Lenitive ſoftneſs may heal the grief.</p>
               <p>In caſe the ſwelling be hard, it is generally Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and muſt have ſuch Medicaments applied: but if ſoft, thoſe of a more ſupple nature will prevail, though many happen to be of a long continuance. And now to know whether a Swelling has been of a long continuance, preſs it with your finger; and if the dint continue after you have taken your finger away, then is it old, and of a long ſtanding; but if the fleſh ſuddainly return, then is it newly taken. If a Swelling or Sore be broken, and moderately mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then it ſignifies a good conſtitution, and that it mends apace; but if the Putrefaction greatly encreaſe,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110035:53"/>then it denotes a maſs of bad humours there contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which muſt by degrees be brought away; and many times in this or the like caſes is Cauterizing actually or potentially uſed, that is, with hot Irons, or with Liquids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which I have before ſpoken above or beneath the Sore, to divert or keep back the humour. And now to that which relates to Cures, <hi>&amp;c-</hi>

                  <p>The Glaunders is a diſtemper often gotten by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding, and ſuddain cooling upon heats; eating too much raw food at unſeaſonable times, or continuing in wet mooriſh ground, proceeding from a flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick conſtitution: And this you may perceive before it take too firm a poſſeſſion by a white matter iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Horſe's Noſtrils, and his unſeaſonable ſnorting: And this Diſeaſe having its ſeat properly in the Head,</p>

                  <p>Take of White-wine Vinegar a quart, Roach-Allom two pounds, a pint of the Juyce of Plantane, and as much of that of Rue, with four ounces of Honey: boil them to the conſumption of a third part, and waſh the grieved part therewith as hot as the Horſe will well endure it morning and evening, and the Canker within a fortnight will decay.</p>

                  <p>The help for this is, firſt feeding the Horſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſuffering a regular digeſtion; and the latter by giving him cooling things to allay the heat, and moderate the Appetite, are the beſt things to reduce him to a due temperature and managed diet, as has been ſaid; but more particularly, give him a quart of Cream, a pint of White-wine boiled with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Wood-ſorrel, and the like quantity of Scabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Mugwort, the liquid part only: Let him take it cold, and reſt upon it, and it will cloſe the Veins to that degree, that the digeſtion may be made perfect; as alſo it will allay the heat.</p>

                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe, it is ever the moſt violent, but never laſteth long, and moſt frequently it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Spring, when the Blood begins to enc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſigns that fore-run this, are the watering of the Eyes, and a redneſs as if they were blood-ſhotten, ſhort pantings, hot breath, a loathing or leaving of Provender, ſtiffneſs in the Joynts, and unwillingneſs to labour; And if it ſo happen that it befall him at eight of the clock the one day, you may expect it at four the next day; and the reaſon that is given, is the ebbing and flowing of the blood, and its circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. To rid him of this troubleſome companion, give him, as ſoon as you perceive it to begin, a warm Maſh, and keep him in motion, though in the Stable, for the ſpace of an hour or more; then rub him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well, and</p>
                  <p>Take two quarts of Ale, a good handfull of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, an ounce of Long-Pepper, Venice-Treacle two ounces, and of Grains an ounce: add to theſe an ounce of the Flower of Brimſtone, and as much Rue dried and rubbed into Powder: heat it hot, and give him it at twice, about the ſpace of two hours differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between each other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tertian</hi> Feaver is much the ſame in quality and condition with what I have named, and the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomps the ſame, though it ſomewhat more than the other participates of the Ague, for it at firſt takes him with a kind of a ſhaking: Wherefore when you obſerve its approach,</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving paſſed over all the Material Diſeaſes and Sorrances any ways incident, hurtfull or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the plaineſt, ſafeſt, and eaſieſt Method; It now remains that I ſpeak ſomething of the Symptoms of Diſeaſes and Diſtempers in general, that they may be the brieflier comprehended, and afterward give directions for making Unguents, Salves, Poultiſes, Clyſters, Suppoſitories, Purging-potions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ought always to be kept in a readineſs for ſundry uſes and emergent occaſions, with ſuch reaſonable directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as may add to what has been already treated of: And of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>The Curious, as I have formerly hinted, have ever had a great regard to the Complexion of a Horſe, thereby to draw from thence more than bare conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the bodily ſtate or conſtitutions relating to health or ſickneſs. And ſince too much of this kind cannot be well laid down, nor more than ſufficiently handled, I ſhall make theſe further Obſervations than what hitherto I have made.</p>
               <p>The Strangles are ſignified by the hanging out and unſeemly colour of a Horſe's Tongue, and by the faintneſs of his breathing.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:110035:96"/>
               <p>When a Horſe is very thirſty, and ſeems very little affected towards his Provender, then has he the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a Feaver, or ſome hot diſeaſe that afflicts the Heart and Liver, or elſe it may ſignifie the Putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs: but when he eats largely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not much water, it denotes a cold Liver, and that the Horſe is ſubject to groſs humours, by reaſon the heat cannot concoct the quantity of nutriment as it ought; and therefore it is not amiſs to reſtrain him from eating altogether ſo much as he requires, or at leaſt to give it him by degrees, that it may leaſurely digeſt.</p>
               <p>If with exceeding greedineſs he devour his Meat and Drink, then beware he be not troubled with the diſeaſes of the Spleen, or putrefaction of the Lungs.</p>
               <p>If the Breath of a Horſe, without travelling or other force or violence, be found very hot, or ſo much as is more than uſual, it denotes the ſymptom of ſome fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh diſeaſe approaching.</p>
               <p>If the left ſide be much ſwelled, and there be no apparent cauſe, then proceeds it from the diſorder of the Spleen; And if the Legs on that ſide be likewiſe ſwelled, then it commonly proceeds to the Dropſey.</p>
               <p>Drivelling or noiſome water deſcending or iſſuing from the Mouth or Noſtrils of a Horſe, denotes the wet Cough; and if it be gellied, or the like, then it threatens him with the Staggers.</p>
               <p>The dullneſs of the Countenance, lolling of the Ears, and hanging of the Head, are ſigns of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, or extraordinary pain in the Head.</p>
               <p>If diſorderly pantings appear on the Breaſt Sides, or any part of the Body, then does the Horſe labour under ſome ſickneſs that afflicts the Heart or Liver.</p>
               <p>If the Mouth be foul and furred, and the Tongue look yellowiſh, then the Lungs are defective, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a Conſumption.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:110035:96"/>
               <p>The hollowneſs of the Temples denotes either the Strangles, or that the Horſe is very old.</p>
               <p>Shortneſs of Breath, hanging of the Eye-lids, and beating of the Flanks, denote a Feaver.</p>
               <p>A cold ſwelling under the Throat, with a ratling in the Head, ſignifie the approaching of the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: If about the Tongue-roots ſmall knobs appear, then it ſignifies Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Horſe offer to cough, and be faint in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as not throughly able to bring up what he offers at, then is it occaſioned by the ſwelling or riſing of the Lungs, or oppreſſive Phlegm ſetled there, which obſtructs the Lungs in the performance of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>The ſtairing up of the hair, and hardneſs of the skin, with dejected looks, and lankneſs of the belly, denote the Horſe foundered in the body, and ſometimes the Wind, Colick, or Stone, is ſignified thereby; as alſo the Yellows; which are all dangerous diſtempers in a Horſe.</p>

                  <p>This word ſpeaks the intention of the thing, which is no other than a preparing before-hand the Horſe's body to receive a Purge or Clyſter. Now for the former,</p>
                  <p>Take Water wherein Wood-ſorrel and Maiden-hair, a herb ſo called, has been boiled, and give it him to drink with his Provender a day before, or Water wherein Deal Saw-duſt has been boiled or ſteeped: the like you may do with the Leaves of Bays or

               <p>PErfumes are much available to remove bad ſcents, or noiſome vapours, from the head or ſtomach of a Horſe; and being moderately and ſeaſonably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, greatly contribute to his health: And in this caſe, if the Horſe be afflicted with cold diſeaſes, or thoſe that proceed from cold raw humours,</p>
               <p>Take Storax and Benjamin, of each half an ounce; <hi>Olibanum</hi> and Frankincenſe, of each a quarter of an ounce; Oyl of <hi>Petrolum</hi> an ounce: bruiſe the Drugs, and make them up in ſmall balls as big as a pea; burn them upon a chafing-diſh of Coles, ſo that the ſmoak may affect the mouth and noſtrils of the Horſe, and that he may draw it in with his breath; and to make him the better ſo to do, put a gag in his mouth that it may ſtand open.</p>
               <p>If the Horſe be troubled with giddineſs in his head, which is known by the dullneſs of the Eyes, burn Feathers under his noſe, ſhavings of Leather or Camel's Hair, or the Seeds of Fennel and Anniſeeds. The Roots of Horſe-radiſh or Ruburb will have the ſame effect, or any thing of ſtrong ſcent, whether Gums, Oyls, Roots, Herbs, or other things of the like nature and quality.</p>
               <p>In caſe of Bathing a Horſe, commonly called the Horſe-Bath, it is no more than the concocting divers,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:110035:105"/>herbs that are cooling and ſupple; and with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid part waſh and ſupple the place grieved, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a limberneſs of the Joynts, or remove dirt, or any the like diſorder or grievance, and may many times upon a Journey be uſed with ſucceſs to reſtore or refreſh a tired Horſe, being applied warm to his Limbs: And the beſt of this kind take as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</p>
               <p>Take Sorrel, Mallows, Groundſel, Cammomoil, Sperage, Sow-thiſtle, Comfory and Scabeous, Endive, Bugloſs and Featherfew: boil them in two gallons of Running-water, and when you find they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently feethed, ſtrain out the Liquid part: or if you find your Horſe much given to coldneſs, you may boil them in Chamber-lye.</p>
               <div type="recipe">
                  <head>Directions for Purging, according to the eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your Horſe.</head>
                  <p>If you perceive your Horſe of a ſtrong conſtitution, not impaired by diſeaſe or want, then may you give him ſtrong provocatives, that by a conquering qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may prevail againſt the diſtemper; but if he be weak and infeebled, then nature being unable to keep her ſtation, and the potion being ſtrong, great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may happen, by reaſon of the fixation or ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the groſs humours and crudities: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſudden and violent operation not being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of removing them, will prey upon, and evacuate thoſe good humours that ſhould ſtrengthen and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the body: And therefore in caſe of weakneſs, a weaker potion muſt be given, that by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and eaſie working, it may by degrees looſen and attract what is offenſive. And now for a gentle Purge:</p>
                  <p>Take two ounces of Turnſole, and half an ounce of the Powder of Alloes: diſſolve them in a quart of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:110035:105"/>Ale, wherein half a dozen Lawrel-leaves have been concocted: give it him warm, and attend the working of it; giving him, the better to hearten him, a Toaſt dipped in Canary about half an hour after: But if the Horſe be ſo ſtrong, that he will diſpence with a violent Purge; then,</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Colloquintida</hi> three ounces, Ruburb in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an ounce, Scamony two grains: diſſolve them in half a pint of the Juyce of Hyſop, and the like quantity of Canary: give them the Horſe very warm, and keep him ſtirring in a warm Stable two hours, at leaſt without giving him any thing; and when by a conquering quality they prevail over the diſtemper, give him a warm maſh, but no hard meat till ſix hours after, by which time it will have done work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And in caſe of cold diſtempers you may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what augment the Doſe. And now as to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, if we take them diſtinctly, Alloes and Caſſia purge Melancholy, <hi>Colloquintida</hi> Phlegm, Ruburb San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, and Scamony Choler. Nor are theſe the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things that do it, but there are are divers others; yet ſeeing I have largely directed on that occaſion, I ſhall wave them in this Chapter.</p>

                  <head>Rowelling; what it is, and how to be performed.</head>
                  <p>Rowelling is no other than making an Inciſion in the fleſh, or rather skin, by taking it up with a bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin or other inſtrument, ſo that a ring of hair, cord or leather may be faſtned in it, anointed with greaſe, oyl, or other things thereby to keep the skin from cloſing upon it, that in the nature of an Iſſue the corrupt humour may be voided: And this is commonly fixed in the breaſt or ſhoulder of a Horſe for a ſtrain, ſlip, or ſwelling. And for your better inſtruction, obſerve as thus:</p>
                  <p>Take a Pen-knife, or other ſharp knife, and ſlit the skin right down for the length of an Inch, or more, gently raiſing it with a flat ſtick; and ſo do on the other ſide, about half a fingers breadth diſtant; ſo that the skin being parted from the fleſh, you may run your finger quite through, and ſo put your Rowel in well anointed, and turn it about every other day, freſhly anointing it. And though this be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of Rowelling, yet the <hi>French</hi> make a ſlit or hole only, and hollow the skin from the fleſh, in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle like a Crown piece; and then cutting a piece of ſtiff unallom'd Leather to the bigneſs, with one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<figure/> big hole in the middle, and four ſmaller ones, as the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Margent, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it with Lard or Oyl of Marſhmallows, and put it in ſo that the Orifice may be left open for the corruption to iſſue out through a ſhort quill which they faſten therein; running likewiſe a Needle and Thread through the four ſmall holes to prevent its turning about, or wearing downwards; and ſo by raiſing up the skin, and blowing the wind into the ſpongy fleſh,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:110035:107"/>cauſe the putrefaction to gather and deſcend, that ſo by the evacuation of the humours the grievance may find a cure; and that it may lye the cloſer, draw two ſtrong ſtitches over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, as you perceive in the ſecond Figure, and let it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till you perceive the humours well evacuated; and then cutting the ſtitches, take it out. And thus have I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed the Material things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this Science.

               <p>HAving thus far advanced in this great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, as I well hope with ſucceſs; I now think it highly neceſſary, for the better encouragement of the Reader, to add ſuch rare Secrets, and other matters, as I doubt not but will confirm him in the ſincere endeavour I uſe to render him in the practice both Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Having Back'd your Horſe in the latter end of the fourth, or beginning of the fifth year, and by gentle means rendred him eaſie and complyable, which by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:110035:109"/>rating, beating, and haring, cannot be ſo well brought to perfection, as by cheriſhing and encouraging him, though ſometimes it muſt be with gentle correction, that he may be the better brought to underſtand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Then the next thing materially to be conſidered, is to what uſe you deſign him, that to the ſame end you may reduce him to Pace, Amble, Trot, Gallop, or the like, as either of them may beſt concur to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Wherefore, that none may plead ignorance herein, I ſhall treat of them in their order briefly and effectually.</p>
               <p>When you mount a Horſe with the intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, you muſt, if he be an unmanaged Horſe, obſerve chiefly the correction or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Voice, Bridle, Switch, Spur, Calves of the Legs, Stirrops and the Ground; all of theſe being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly uſed in the true Management of a Horſe. But being to be obſerved, as the diſcreet Rider ſhall ſee occaſion for the beſt advantage, it would be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to ſet down directions of this kind; though in general I muſt ſay, that they muſt be done with diſcretion, and in ſeaſon; or elſe inſtead of redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the facilitating of Management, they may turn much to its diſadvantage in rendring the Horſe reſtiff, or hardning him in the Vice of going backward. And now as the true Amble is the juſteſt meaſure a Horſe can take to ground him in, and render him ſenſible of all other motions; I proceed in the firſt place to give directions how, and by what means he muſt be brought to undertake it with eaſe and cheerfulneſs, for if the contrary happen, he will hardly be brought to the perfection you wiſh.</p>
               <p>Obſerve when your Horſe is well broke, that he will patiently endure the Bitt and the Rider; that you take him into Plough'd land, not too deep nor cloggy, by reaſon of Clay or lying low; nor muſt it be done in wet weather, nor ſuddenly after a ſhowre: And here Rack him a good going pace, till he begins to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:110035:109"/>be a little warm, and feels his Legs well: And ſo do often morning and evening, ſtraining and forcing him ever now and then beyond that pace, when as you will in a ſhort time perceive him to fall into a kind of an Amble, but ſo ſhuffling, that it is not fit for him long to continue it in this manner, leaſt by cuſtome it becomes habitual; though in ancient times this was the way both held and practiced, whereby the Horſes were brought to the motion of Ambling. But ſince time and experience has furniſhed us with better, it would be ingratitude not to embrace them: And therefore, for brevity ſake, paſſing over the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcourſes and opinions of ſome that hold it beſt for a Horſe to fall out of a Gallop into an Amble, of others that would oblige him to it by Loading him with exceſſive weights; and ſome again, and thoſe not a few, that would have him brought to it by hand between two Rails; Others there are, and they more erronious than any I have named, who would have the Horſe loaded with ſhooes of extraordinary weight to force him thereto, which by often uſing he muſt conſequently be diſabled to perform any motion as he ought: And indeed opinions in this caſe are ſo many and various, that it would be endleſs in a manner to trace them; many of which, though guilded with ſeeming poſſibility, I willingly omit, and proceed to that which my Experience tells me cannot fail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if rightly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Directions in performance of which, take as followeth.</p>
               <p>Having trained your Horſe, by the help of the Ploughed Land, or other gentle means, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Rack-pace, to fall into an Amble, though he preſenty leave it again, and fall to any other motion: Then take ſtrong new Lines made of Hemp or Flax, about the thickneſs of a Jack-line, well ſhrunk and dried, that they may neither reach nor ſhrink in uſing.

Then take Girth-web, as much as will reach over his back, and come down to reach the cords on both ſides, exactly in the middle, wrap it round the cords, but ſo as it may not ſtrain or lift them up, nor ſuffer them to ſink lower than their juſt evenneſs; and then faſten them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by running a Tag through Aglet-holes made for the ſame purpoſe, or by Pack-thread with a Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>needle; And this, called a <hi>Tramel,</hi> being one of the beſt and exacteſt for this purpoſe that can be made.</p>
               <p>Your Horſe being accounter'd in the manner before mentioned, on a plain firm ground, not over ſtony, move him at firſt gently, that he may have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to feel the Tramel, the better to avoid twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; and ſo by degrees let him fall into his Amble by moderately managing the Bridle, and holding your Switch between his Ears that he wreth nor wry not his Neck, cheriſhing him with your Voice, and giving him, when he has done well, ſome pleaſant morſel; but by no means put him to it beyond his ability, leaſt it become tedious to him, and create in him an irkſomeneſs and diſlike; and in ſo uſing him ſeveral

               <p>Having brought your Horſe pretty well to Amble by the Tramel, inſomuch that he does it not confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or againſt his will, either by hand or backing, you may take him into uneven ground, and try him in ſuch ways as you imagine you may have occaſion to Ride him in, never ſtanding to pick or chuſe your ground, but Ride him as far as is ſafe, according as your fancy leads you, yet not without the Tramel fixed on one ſide, which you may ſhift as you ſee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and when you find him perfect, you may Ride him without, only carry the Tramel with you, in caſe he make a default; the beſt way is to bring him back to that default, and make him ſenſible that he has committed an error, which can be no better done than by demonſtration; and in ſo often uſing him, the time will come, and that within three months at fartheſt, that he will be perfect in his exerciſe.</p>
               <p>There is to be conſidered next to what has been ſpoken, the Trot; and that conſiſts in two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the lofty and ſwift Trot; and although to the latter a good Amble is naturally given, yet the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires deliberation and judgment. And ſince Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has afforded a Rule, I think not convenient to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:110035:111"/>conceal it: which, as the beſt Experiment, I deliver as followeth.</p>
               <p>In this caſe a Horſe uſed to the great Saddle, is the fittingeſt to be undertaken, or one you deſign for that or the like purpoſe. Wherefore having choſen your Horſe, faſten on him the War-Saddle, girting it indifferently ſtrait; then put on a Kerb-bridle, and faſtning to the Chain thereof a Leather-ſtrap, bring it by a Buckle to bear on the Breaſt-plate or Girths under the Horſe's Legs, or which of them you ſhall perceive moſt convenient, till you bring the Neck of the Horſe to bend or bear Arch-wiſe like the neck of a Swan: which done, mount your Horſe, and move him a Racking-pace till you find him begin to take up his Legs round and clever, moving his Knees in a manner to his Breaſt, or bringing the upper and lower ſpaces between the Joynts to an equal bearing; and ſo continue to exerciſe him till you find him move in that manner according to your expectation: And then you may try him without the Straps, and by that means perfect him as you ſee occaſion. Now ſome there are, that upon the firſt Backing uſe to Log their Horſes with broad and heavy Shooes: But theſe I diſapprove, and chiefly for two Reaſons:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, becauſe they greatly endamage the Hoof; and not ſo only, but by their weight ſtrain and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the Sinews, that a Horſe muſt of neceſſity be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take up his Legs with pain, which will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubject him to ſtiffneſs and ſtumbling.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, they will endanger the Sinews by bruiſing and cutting, and thereby cauſe the Bone-ſpavin, Screw-pin, Ring-bone or Quitter-bone; All which, for the moſt part, proceed from the like ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and defect of Judgment in Managing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if you would perfect him to the great Saddle, conſider farther, that it is highly neceſſary to manage him at the Ring, that he may be capable of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:110035:111"/>and turning upon the leaſt motion; and this Ring muſt be upon ſoft ſandy ground, where having gently circled him till you have trod out a Ring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fifty and ſixty Paces in compaſs, oblige him to trace it, reſting him on the right, and cheriſhing him on the left; ſtopping him likewiſe upon the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as you ſee occaſion; ſometimes in the midſt of the circle, and at other times where he began; ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe, as you ſee convenient, your hand, and mending your pace, obliging him upon a full ſtop to retire a pace or two backward; and ſo from a Trot you may fall to the Gallop, ever obſerving that Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping to the right, he leads with his left foot; and ſo conſequently Galloping to the left, that he leads to the right; and in ſo doing he will perform it with eaſe and delight; when, on the contrary, if he carrys both his feet even, leading with neither, he muſt do it with pain, and be apt ſometimes to ſtrike: and this is ever beſt in caſe of a full ſpeed upon a ſtraight Courſe; and ſo in uſing convenient Bitts and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and keeping a ſteady hand, you may ſtop him upon a full career, and oblige him ſuddenly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, if any imminent danger be apparent, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for your pleaſure; and by ſuch-like manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you may bring him to the Turnings and ſtrait Turns with little difficulty, and indeed perfect him for any conſiderable Exerciſe; in the performance of which, he ought likewiſe to be conſidered more than what I have formerly mentioned.</item>
               </list>
               <p>When you intend your Horſe for Travel, Sport, or the like, more than what I have already given directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as to Managing, that he may well endure, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your expectation. Obſerve to dreſs him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in the ſame manner as has been directed for the Running-horſe; and having by you Dog's-greaſe or Neatsfoot-oyl, anoint him therewith, eſpecially his Joynts, ſuppling it in with your warm hands, or a warm cloth; and in ſo comforting the Nerves and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:110035:112"/>Sinews, you will oblige the Horſe to hold out much the better; and in the morning give him three quarts of well-ſifted Oats, ſweet and good, with a quart of Beans ſplit, and the husks taken off, and after them a quart of Ale: And ſo being Accoutered to your mind, Ride him forth a Racking-pace, till you find his Joynts very plyable, which will be within a Mile or two Riding; then mend his pace, and by degrees put him to either Amble, Trot or Gallop, as beſt ſhall pleaſe you till you come to your Inn.</p>
               <p>Being come to the end of your Stage, if the Horſe ſweat, take off his cloaths by degrees, and with a piece of broken Sword, Scithe or edged Lath, ſcrape him all over, and after that rub him with dry wiſps or woollen cloths; then paſs your hand over him, cleanſe his Paſterns and Fetlocks from dirt and gravel, pick his feet, and caſt a cloth over him, and give him his potion of meat, which muſt be a third part more at leaſt than what his uſual allowance is when he ſtands ſtill; and if you find him very hot within, you may give him Water and Ale a like quantity, both being a little warmed, eſpecially in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and anoint his Limbs with the ſame materials, and in the ſame manner I have before mentioned; and if you find his breath ſhort, give him an ounce of Hemp-ſeed well bruiſed in a glaſs of Canary or warm Ale, ever forbearing to waſh your Horſe when he is hot, that is, to Ride him into a Pond, or the like; but rather, if he be exceeding dirty, warm a Pail full of Water, and with wiſps rub him gently clean; or having firſt rubbed off the dirt with dry wiſps, you may cleanſe the reſt with a Bruſh. And thus much I thought fit to lay down as a ſupplement to what has been formerly ſpoken, not much different in the caſes of Ordering and Management; and ſo proceed to Particulars and Generals of another nature, though tending to the ſame center.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:110035:115"/>Peaſe-ſtraw, wherein the green husks of Walnuts and Red Sage have been concocted.</p>
                  <p>To take off hair, Take Soot of Wood two ounces, Oyl of Tartar two drams, the Calcine of Egg-ſhells half an ounce, with an ounce of unſlaked Lime: make them into a Plaſter with Oyl of Spike, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the place you deſign to have bare or thinner, the hair at that time being cloſe clipped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stars, Blazes, Snips; what they are, and how to make them for Ornament or Diſguiſe in any part of the Horſe where they may be conveniently ſcituate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are held, by the Curious, to be great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Horſes; and therefore many have ſtuddied how to make them, and left ſundry directions as their Opinions, how they ought to be made. But ſince they vary, and many of them upon tryal have proved frivolous and ineffectual; therefore I ſhall only give the approved manner and method of making things of this kind.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, if you would have a white Star in a Horſe of a different colour, take up the skin, where you endeavour to ſcituate it, with a Bodkin or fine Lancet round about, or as you deſign the mark; and making a piece of Lead, or divers pieces, the better to get them into the hole, that you within ſide the hollowed skin may be framed to the proportion, dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thoſe pieces in Oyl of Spike or Turpentine; by which means the skin being ſeparated from the fleſh, and receiving no manner of Alumentary moiſture, will ſhead the hair: which when you perceive, take out the Lead, and clap it cloſe to the fleſh, having anointed the Wound with Honey of Roſes, and the next hair that comes will be of a perfect White. Now there are thoſe that take up the skin by running two Pins or Bodkins croſs-ways, and binding them about
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:110035:116"/>with a Pack-thread till the skin be drawn up like a Purſe, that ſo the skin may mortifie: but I hold the firſt the beſt.</p>

                  <head>To make a Black Star in a white Horſe.</head>
                  <p>Take of Souters Ink half an ounce, four ſcruples of Oliander-wood beaten to Powder, the Juyce of Hemlock half an ounce, Oyl of Ebony two drams, and Vitriol two drams: often with theſe, well incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, anoint the deſigned place. Or for want of theſe, Take Galls, the Ruſt of Iron, Oyl of Tartar, and the Aſhes of Fern-roots, of each a like quantity: bruiſe them well together, and apply them Plaſter-wiſe till the hair ſheads; and then obſerve the next that comes will be black.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:110035:117"/>ſeldom experienced, I leave it to be tried by thoſe that deſire it, and proceed to other matters: But by the way I ſhall ſay thus much, that if the feet by the aforeſaid Experiment can be changed in Colour, then conſequently the Tail, Ears, or any other part of the Body, by the like application, may be the ſame.</p>

                  <p>If your Horſe has loſt his Ears and thereby becomes uncomely, you may ſupply them with thoſe of a dead Horſe, by ſewing and glewing them on ſo artificially, that the Horſe by moving the roots of his Ears, ſhall move them as if they were naturally his own. But as a farther myſtery, ſome have held, and indeed it bears the face of a poſſibility, that the ſtump of the Ears being pared, ſo that being taken off to the Quick, as near the roots as may be, and the Ears of another Horſe new cut off, clapped on warm, and ſewed down whilſt the blood iſſues from the ſtumps, they will by being anointed with Oyl of Juniper or Bays, by a kind of Inoculation graft themſelves to the ſtumps or roots, and become natural. And this they hold likewiſe may be done by Teeth, in putting a Tooth juſt drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place from whence a ſtump is juſt drawn like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. This alſo they hold may be done by the Tail of a Horſe; but not having been proved by me, I leave the Experiment to the diſcretion of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Falſe Manes there are likewiſe to ſupply ſuch as fall off; and are not altogether improper, becauſe they ſerve for Ornament as well as the beſt; and theſe are taken off from dead Horſe's skin and roots; and being Tanned or dried, ſo that the Leather becomes plyable, and may be ſhaved ſo thin on the fleſhy ſide, that it will ſit cloſe to the live Horſe's creſt, off from which the hair is ſhaved or taken by the roots, with Applications, it being firſt clapped on with Glew or Pitch, may be ſewed to the Horſe's skin, in ſuch a manner, that the hairs of the one, and the other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the ſeams, it will hardly be diſcerned, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a diſtance.</p>

                  <head>How to Manage a Horſe in Leaping, taking a Hedge, Gate, Stile, Ditch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Many have held this a difficult piece of Horſeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as indeed it is; for by ill management in this affair, either the Horſe or Man has been often ſpoiled; and ſometimes both of them together; and ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents fall out through the careleſneſs of the Rider, or ill management of the Horſe. Wherefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it, and prevent danger, let the Rider obſerve, that he not only ſit faſt himſelf upon the motion of Riſe, but that bearing ſomewhat forward to give the Horſe the more ſway, he keep the Reins even and ſteady on either hand; but not too hard, leaſt the Horſe riſing too high, may happen to over-ſet or loſe by ſuch a motion the force of the ſpring of his hinder Legs, and by that means be rendred leſs able to cant his body, or draw them nimbly after him, which frequently occaſions a ſtrain or ſlip, eſpecially at a Ditch. And the beſt way on this occaſion to hold your Rod or Whip, is either between his Ears, or ſomewhere out of ſight, leaſt it cauſe him to boggle, by inclining more to the one hand than to the other; or for fear of being corrected, force himſelf beyond his reach. As for your Legs, you ought to keep them moderately cloſe to his Sides, but not ſo cloſe as to preſs his Ribs, for that will oblige him to bate of his ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>At a Gate or Stile ever obſerve your diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſuffer your Horſe to take it, which ought to be ſomewhat more than a Man's pace from it, leaſt by the over-reaching of the fore-legs the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-legs either ſtrike or ſtick in the barrs, which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:110035:119"/>through the ſudden motion occaſions an extraordinary bruiſe, if not the Leg to ſnap ſhort off.</p>
                  <p>As for a Ditch, rather chuſe to leap againſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate riſing bank, than upon a decent or low place, becauſe in doing the latter the Horſe comes down with ſo great a force, that he will be either apt to ſtumble on his noſe, if not well ſupported by a ſteady hand, or elſe to ſprain or ſlip his ſhoulder.</p>
                  <p>As for the Hedge-leaping, the greateſt care required is to ſhun the Stakes, and the like to be done by the ſharp ends of Pails, leaſt the Horſe by an Over-reach gore himſelf: And in this caſe conſider both the Bank and the Ditch, if any there be, leaſt you force your Horſe upon a thing too hard for him, and by that means be both together left in the mire, or in a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer condition. Nor is it convenient in Hunting to ride a Horſe in places where theſe things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unleſs he be managed at leaſure before hand, for being upon full-ſpeed your Horſe ſeeing others who are managed, undertake theſe matters of difficulty; and thereby prompted to imitate them, will in ſpite perhaps of your utmoſt endeavour to the contrary, reſolutely attempt to follow them; for indeed no Creature deſires more to Emulate his like than a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Horſe, nor, according to his underſtanding, is more proud of winning praiſe and applauſe: For, as the Poet has it,</p>

The Rack ought to be made of firm Oak, both the Bearings and the Staves, that the Horſe may have the leſs power to bite them, if he be ſo inclined; and the Mangers be likewiſe made of firm Plank, well ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and dried, having Pins or Wooden-pegs conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently placed to hang the Bridles, Saddles, Girths, Cloths, Rubbers, Combs, Bruſhes, and the like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials on; obſerving, if conveniency will permit, to have a couple of Windows to open, one to the North, and the other to the South; opening the firſt in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to let in the cool Air, as occaſion requires; and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:110035:121"/>the laſt in dry Sun-ſhiny days in Winter, to let in the cheriſhing heat, or freſh and gentle gails, which will contribute to the vivacity of the Horſe, and render him more ſprightfull; and ever give him for his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wheat or Rye-ſtraw; but of theſe two, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is the beſt; and if you perceive him ſubject alſo to eat his Litter, you muſt Muzzle him after that he has ended his Provender, leaſt he otherwiſe do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an ill habit of body; ever giving him his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender in due time, with convenient opportunity to take his reſt at ſeaſonable times: And if it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as in many caſes it is neceſſary, that you Shooe him your ſelf: or if done by another, in giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the beſt advantage, you may take the following Rules.</p>
               <p>If it happen to be the hinder feet you undertake, then conſider the Toe is ever the tendereſt part, and muſt be pared with a gentle hand, being left of a convenient thickneſs, that it may be capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Quick from Gravel, Sand, or being hurt by ſtriking againſt hard ſtones; ſuffering the Shooe likewiſe to be thicker at the Toe than in any other part; which Shooe muſt be ſet on even and cleaver, not inclining to one part more than another, which you muſt conſider after your having pared the hoof to an evenneſs, and ſtruck a Nail on each ſide, not only by narrowly viewing it, but by ſuffering the Horſe to ſet his foot on the ground; and if any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs happen that is not over-great, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by ſtriking the hoof with the Hammer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trouble of drawing the Nails, both your Shooe and Nails being made of tough Iron, that they may in no-wiſe be ſubject to break, and ſo in a Journey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your hope, the holes for the Nails being made moſtly towards the Heels, becauſe of the weakneſs of the Toe.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:110035:121"/>
               <p>In caſe the Foot has a falſe quarter, which looks in a manner like a piece put in, then muſt the Shooe have on that part a Button, or be a little more rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than the other on the inſide, a ſmall ſpace from the quarter nearer to the Toe, that thereby the ſtreſs may be taken off the quarter ſo defective, and the Horſe thereby rendred uncapable of limping.</p>
               <p>If by reaſon of the ſwelling or ſtanding of the hoof inward the Horſe be apt to interfeer, then muſt ſo much of it as is convenient be taken away with a Raſp; and in paring the outſide, ſuffer the inſide to be ſomewhat of the higheſt, that it may oblige the Horſe to tread a little outward: or if it cannot be ſo well done in paring the hoof, let it be in the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſhooe on that ſide more than on the other, fixing the edges ſo cloſe to the hoof, that it may have no opportunity to cut or interfeer; and in caſe the Horſe be hoof-bound, anoint his hoofs with Oyl of Turpentine, and ſtop his feet with new Cow-dung fryed in Olive-oyl or Hog's Lard, making him a ſhooe in the form of a Half-moon, that by its open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it may be no obſtruction to the increaſe or ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the hoof: And this may ſuffice for the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-feet in caſe of any reaſonable hoof; From which I ſhall proceed to thoſe of the fore-feet.</p>
               <p>In caſe the hoofs of the fore-feet be well placed and ſound, even, firm and tough, then any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhooe will ſerve the turn; yet in this caſe muſt it be pared, and kept from running to diſorder; and when you have occaſion to Travel much in Winter, or in any wet ſeaſon, it will not be amiſs, to prevent its fretting and expanding, to ſeer the edges with a Barr, or other piece of Iron, ſuffering the ſhooe to ſwell no more on the toe than on the heel, becauſe, in this caſe, the heel is the tendereſt part, and muſt, the rather of the two, riſe higher than the toe; and if the Horſe be not ſubject to interfeer, you may
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:110035:122"/>ſuffer the ſhooe, for the preſervation of the hoof, to ſtand a ſtraws breadth beyond it, even every way; Nailing it on in ſuch wiſe, that the points of the Nails may ſtand in an even round, and ſeem upon their ringing off and clenching to ſink ſomewhat into the hoof; ever obſerving to keep Gravel from under the ſhooes. Now there are divers ſorts of unnatural and offenſive hoofs, hapning through neglect or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; ſome of them that will never bear a ſhooe well, and others that cannot be brought to it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much pain and induſtry: And the principal of theſe are,</p>
               <p>The rugged hoof, the brittle hoof, the narrow heels, the flat hoof, the broad fruſh, and the crooked hoof; and to theſe ſhooes muſt be purpoſely made and fitted, and the paring be ſhaped accordingly: The Particulars of which being uncertain, or at leaſt too tedious for this diſcourſe, I refer them to the Skilfull Farrier, whoſe proper buſineſs it is to order and reduce them, ſo as they may become practicable and uſefull.</p>
               <p>If the hoof be damaged by reaſon of any Nail that lurks therein, not eaſily to be found, it muſt by all means be looked after, and taken thence; and the place of its aboad or lodgment may be found by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry means and ways, but chiefly by the heat of that place more than any other, or by the Horſe's ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his foot, or ſtrike thereon, or pinch it with your Pincers.</p>
               <p>The place being found, pull off the ſhooe, and open the foot gently with a Buttreſs or Drawing-knife; and if you can come at it, pull it out; if not, apply the Plaſter I have mentioned for drawing out Thorns, Stubs or Splinters: Or, for your more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this:</p>
               <p>Having in the beſt manner laid open the Wound, Take of Stone-pitch, Tar, Turpentine and Bees<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wax,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:110035:122"/>of each an ounce, and half a quarter of a pint of Juyce of Garlick: make them over a gentle fire into a Plaſter, and apply them as hot as may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. And ſometimes it ſo happens, that by long continuance the Nail in working breaks out above the hoof; and in ſuch a caſe apply Honey, Burgundy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitch, and Powder of burnt Allom: or a Poultis of Mallows, Cammomoil and Groundſel fryed in Hog's Lard, and beaten up with the Whites of Eggs and Rye-meal, and applying it as hot as may be endured; and in ſo often doing it will break the Skin, ſo that the cauſe of the grievance may be removed; but by the addition of half an ounce of Verdegreaſe it will bring away the Corruption, and heal the Wound.</p>

                  <head>Critical Days, and the Obſervation thereon.</head>
                  <p>AND now ſince it may not be amiſs to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Critical Days,</hi> obſerved by many as to Health and Sickneſs; which relate not only to humane Conſtitutions, but thoſe of all Creatures; I ſhall here incert them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe days are accounted ſuch wherein are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted Alterations in relation to Sickneſs or Health, Life or Death: And as for the <hi>Critick-day,</hi> it is ever principally to be obſerved after the beginning of the ſickneſs, as the 3.5.7.9.11.14.17.21.28. In which days ſo curſarily to be obſerved, no ſtrong Medicines or Purgations ought to be given: Nor is it convenient to let Blood, unleſs great neceſſity require it; And other days there are in which many Learned Men hold. If Man or Beaſt fall ſick, he ſhall
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:110035:123"/>hardly eſcape, and that not without much difficulty, which are noted to be theſe, <hi>viz. January</hi> 1.7. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 3.4. <hi>March</hi> 1.4. <hi>April</hi> 8.10. <hi>May</hi> 2.7. <hi>June</hi> 10.15. <hi>July</hi> 11.13. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3.2. <hi>September</hi> 3.10. <hi>November</hi> 3.5. <hi>December</hi> 7.10. And many add, that if any dangerous diſeaſe happen on the 10th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1ſt</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> or 6th of <hi>April,</hi> it will go very near to terminate in Death. Now there are on the contrary, other days held to be good days; and that if a diſeaſe happen on them, there is great hopes of recovery; nay, there is great hopes of ſucceeding in taking a Journey, or any Labour wherein Man or Beaſt is concerned; and theſe are held to be the <hi>3d</hi> and 13th of <hi>January.</hi> The 5th and 28th of <hi>February.</hi> The <hi>3d, 22d</hi> and 30th of <hi>March.</hi> The 5th, <hi>22d</hi> and 29th of <hi>April.</hi> The 4th and 28th of <hi>May.</hi> The <hi>3d</hi> and 8th of <hi>June.</hi> The 12th, 13th, and 15th of <hi>July.</hi> The 12th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The <hi>1ſt,</hi> 7th, 24th, and 28th of <hi>September.</hi> The 4th and 15th of <hi>October.</hi> The 13th and 19th of <hi>November.</hi> The <hi>23d</hi> and 26th of <hi>December.</hi> And theſe indeed, by the Antients, were held in wonderfull eſteem, they generally taking their meaſures thereby as to what I have ſaid in relation to them; nor are they to be neglected or ſlighted by Practitioners in Phyſical or Chyrurgical matters, either in relation to Man or Beaſt; no, nor in their undertaking, relating to Labour, or the like, but have</p>

                        <hi>Some further Conſiderations upon the Cauſe of Diſeaſes, and how to Remove them, Phyſically diſcuſſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of a Diſeaſe proceeds principally from an effect againſt Nature, and happens either Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or Internal; the External is that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly viſible, and conſiſts generally of what comes by Strokes, Bruiſes, Wrenches, Scalds, Shot, or any
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:110035:123"/>manner of Wound; Thoſe Internal are occult, or hid within the body, and conſequently the leſs diſcernable, and are divided into an Antecedent and Conjunction. The Conjunction is that which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and immediately cauſes the Diſeaſe, and is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held to be the Blood which cauſes the Phlegm; nor is it reckoned the Antecedent doth actually cauſe the diſeaſe, but procures matter, and ſtirs it up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the creating a diſeaſe; but between it and the diſeaſe are ſome Cauſes placed, <hi>viz.</hi> abundance of humours and ill digeſtion; and therefore theſe things ought to be chiefly conſidered before any one abſolutely attempts to diſpell the diſeaſe, by reaſon diſeaſes are firſt cured by removing the Cauſe Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and after that the Cauſe Conjunct: And as for the External diſeaſes, they ought to be known, becauſe they breed diſeaſes Internal, and very much change the blood, and with much diligence are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſought out, that ſo the Practitioner may be brought to the perfect knowledge of Internal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; and theſe External diſeaſes are not either to be avoided or amended, but neceſſarily penetrate the body, as Air infected, Meat, Drink, Labour, Sleep, Watching or Wakefulneſs, Repletion and Evacuation, and ſome diſorders that frequently happen, or to be avoided as unneceſſary; as Bruiſes, Strains, Slips, Wounds, Strangling, or the like.</p>
                     <p>As for the true cauſe of a diſeaſe, it ſometimes proceeds from corrupt matter whereof they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: or when either the Sire or Dam is infected with any diſeaſe, the corrupt quality of which flowing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Seminal-veſſels, and tranſmitting the like to the creature generated making it hereditary; and at other times it proceeds from bad uſage, bad feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heats, colds, and many more which I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the firſt Part. And again, as I have here hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Internal diſeaſes may proceed from External
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:110035:124"/>ſtrokes, bruiſes, or the like. And thus much for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Obſervations of this kind: From whence I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give an accurate relation of the Spirits, by which the frame of Life is ſupported: which take as followeth.</p>

                        <hi>The Spirits; what they are, with their Office,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit is the Aerious and ſubtil ſubſtance of a Body generated of the moſt pure and thin Blood, and is the Original mover and ſupporter of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, giving them power to perform their office, and is ſeated chiefly in the Brain and Heart, from whence it delates it ſelf by the means of the Nerves and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into all parts of the body, and is divided into three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Animal, Vital and Natural; the Animal peculiarly claims the Brain for its ſeat, for there it is prepared and made, and from thence defu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf inſenſible ways to the Eyes, Ears, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The Vital Spirit is chiefly ſeated in the left Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart, and has its paſſage through the Arteries, being made of the Evaporation or ſweet-breathing of the pureſt blood, and is furniſhed with matter to rarifie it from the Air that is drawn in by the Lungs, and by its motion through the frame of the body is the conſervation of natural heat.</p>
                     <p>The Natural Spirit is ingendred in the Liver and Veins, and is wonderfully inſtrumental in the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the nutriment, and turning it into blood, and then is farther imployed in diſtributing it through the Veins that branch from the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> into every part of the Body. And if any of theſe are waſted or expulſed from its proper ſeat, unleſs it ſpeedily return, there is no hopes of life: And ſo in caſe of Famiſhing, <hi>viz.</hi> When the nutriment in the ſtomach is ſpent, then nature preys upon the Blood, and after that upon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:110035:124"/>the Humour; and laſtly, upon the Vital Spirits; at what time the Body, though alive, is paſt recovery.</p>

                        <hi>A further Deſcription of the External Parts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And now, the better to deſcribe, or at leaſt make the Reader more ſenſible of the Chyrurgecal part of this Book, I proceed to give a brief Relation of the Material parts of a Horſe's Body. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Members are bodies, ingendred of the firſt commixion of the Elements, Humours and Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are found to conſiſt of a ſolid, fleſhy, and ſpirituous Subſtance; and theſe are diſtinguiſhed by, or divided into Eight principal Parts, as Bones, Sinews, Ligaments, Tendons, Fibers, Membranes, and ſimple Fleſh and Skin; to which may be joyned Veins, Fat, Marrow, Arteries, Hair, Hoofs, and the like. Now to come nearer the purpoſe, a Bone is of ſubſtance Earthly, dry and hard, the better to ſupport the frame of the Body, and is it ſelf nouriſhed through little pores, by the pureſt fat converted through heat into Marrow. A Griſtle is likewiſe termed a ſoft and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bone, the better to ſtrengthen and move the Members. A Ligament is a tough and more plyable kind of a Griſtle, holding or binding the Bones toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A Tendon is the end and tail of the Arbitrary Muſcles by which the Members are more eaſily moved. A Fiber is a ſmall thread, firm and ſtrong, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture places in the Muſcles to create a right motion, or a motion every way; for as the right Fibers draw forward, the Tranſverſe put back, and the oblique hold faſt. A Membrane and a Coat differ only in this, <hi>viz.</hi> A Membrane is the name of a Subſtance, and the Coat the name of an Office; for where a Membrane inveſts any part, it is called a Coat. As for the Skin, it is generally called the great Membrane, covering
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:110035:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>the whole Body, and over-caſting the frame or ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, and is made ſpongy or porus, the better to purge out the Excremental moiſture by ſweat. As for the Fleſh and Fat increaſed by nouriſhment, it is raiſed and produced from and by the pureſt ſort of blood and nutriment: And when between all theſe there is a concordance and agreement, then is there a cheerfulneſs in the ſpirits, and a harmony throughout the frame of nature.</p>
                     <p>As for the Materials you ought to furniſh your ſelf withall, for the performance of the ſundry Cures I have mentioned, if you are unskilfull in knowing them, or any of them. As for the Herbs and Roots, a Herbal will direct you; and for the Minerals, Gums, Seeds, Barks, Oyls, and the like, you may conſult ſome Druggiſt: For ſhould I go about to deſcribe them particularly, they would take up a large Volume; and when that was done, you not perhaps much the wiſer, unleſs the Portraictures were likewiſe diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherefore let it ſuffice that I have ſpoken intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly of all things which I conceived neceſſary or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on this Subject; and have, according to my promiſe, expoſed to your view, and left to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſundry rare Receipts and Experiments, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before in Print; and ſuch as, I doubt not, will be Approved by thoſe that vouchſafe to try them, and turn not only to their Pleaſure, but Advantage, and be a means to preſerve this Generous Creature in a ſtate of health and ſtrength, and render him tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obedient to his Owner: And in ſuch hopes I remain further to ſerve you, as opportunity or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion will admit.</p>
